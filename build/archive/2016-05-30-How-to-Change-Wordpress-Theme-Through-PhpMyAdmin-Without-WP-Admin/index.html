How to Change the Theme through your Database:
This is useful if you do not have access to your wp-admin, if wp-admin isnât
working, etc. You can look at the available themes that you have installed in
your website files in wp-content/themes. Preferably, it would be best if you
had  the default twentyfifteen, twentyfourteen, etc. themes to use. Keep those
handy for step 3 of this section.
These are the tools available in many Linux hosting platforms that can help
you to change your theme without needing to access to wp-admin.
1. Access and find your database in phpmyadmin.
2. Find the database table ending with _options (if there are multiple check
what the database prefix is in the wp-config.php file and find the table
beginning with the specified prefix ending with _options)
3. Find the âTemplateâ and âStylesheetâ rows. Change the values to
whatever default themes you have available in your wp-content/themes folder
(some examples would be "twentyfifteen" or "twentysixteen")
