A script is essentially a program that contains a group of commands that will
be executed upon request.

Writing a BASH script when using Linux command line is very helpful to make
repetitive tasks a lot quicker. The first company I worked for I often found
myself doing repetitious tasks through SSH such as installing Wordpress to a
directory for a customer.

The purpose of this article is to walk a user on how to make a simple, usable
BASH script. The example I will be using in this script is a series of commands
that will install Wordpress to the working directory you are in.


Step 1: Create the file
In your favorite text editor create a file named "script.sh". The ".sh" file
extension indicates that it is a shell script. Within the file copy and paste
the following content:


#!/bin/bash


wget wordpress.org/latest.zip; unzip latest.zip; cd wordpress; mv * ..; cd ..;
rm -rf wordpress; rm latest.zip


This string of commands downloads the latest copy of Wordpress from http://
wordpress.org/latest.zip, extracts the .zip file, moves all the content to the
directory you are in, then deletes the zipped file and the empty "wordpress"
directory.

Save the file.


Step 2: Make the file executable
By making the file executable we tell the operating system that it can
essentially run the commands. This can be simply done by running this command:

chmod u+x script.sh

The "chmod u+x" command modifies the permissions of the file to be executable
to the user that created the file.


Step 3: Create an alias for the script
Creating an alias essentially allows you to create a shortcut to a script.

Typically in a Linux system, a file named .bashrcis created by the system and
one of its primary uses is for user aliases. It is typically located in the
user's home directory. I prefer the text editor vim, so to edit the file I
would run the command

    vim ~/.bashrc


or the full location would be
 

    vim /home/user/.bashrc


Anyway, edit the .bashrcfile. Let's suppose the alias you wanted to set for the
script is wpinstall. Also, let's suppose I saved the script.sh file to "/home/
user/.scripts/script.sh". If I wanted to assign the alias wp-install to the
script /home/user/.scripts/script.sh this is what I would need to add this text
to my .bashrcfile.


alias wpinstall='/home/user/.scripts/script.sh'



After saving the file, run this command:

    source ~/.bashrc



Step 4: Execute the script
Assuming that all the steps previously were executed correctly to run the
script the command I would need to type would be wpinstall. This command will
now execute the script "script.sh" that installs Wordpress to your current
working directory.
