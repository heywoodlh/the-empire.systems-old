 title: Advantages of Having a Home Server date: '2016-06-01 01:30:00' tags:
- apache - linux - owncloud - server  Over the past year, I have set up my
own home server and have been able to do some pretty neat and useful things for
an extremely low price. The purpose of this article is to share the advantages
I have seen from having my own home server. First, what is a server?Â  Upon
telling people that I have a server at my house, I typically receive one of two
responses: 1. "What do you mean you have a server at your house? Why would you
want that?" 2. "Wow, that's difficult, but reallyimpressive" (normally with a
lack of interest in the person's tone). Occasionally, a third response I rarely
receive from a technologically passive audience is a glazed over look that
silently states, "I don't know what that means, and I don't care." Fair enough.
To be simple, a server is just a computer that is set up to allow other
computers access to its resources. An everyday example of someone using the
features available from a server is Netflix. At the beginning, a Netflix user
creates a Netflix account which allows them to access Netflix's content,
located on a server somewhere in the world. Your computer, TV, phone or tablet
(using a browser or Netflix app) is able to receive information from the media
storage on Netflix's servers and stream the content. This is the case with
almost any sort of online application including Facebook, Pandora, etc. Servers
are the computers that make these applications work and deliver the content to
the users. By understanding this it is much easier to conclude that servers
play a much bigger behind-the-scenes role in a lot of peoples' lives than most
people may realize. Why would I ever want a server? In understanding that a
server can deliver content to you, one can understand that there can be so many
personal uses for a server as everyone wants their content ready and delivered
to them yesterday. Essentially, it all depends on the kind of content that you
would like to have readily available for your convenience. People are
continuously building and improving server software and making them more and
more user friendly so that nearly anyone willing to take the time and read some
online articles can make a server at their home for very little to no cost.
Here are some simple examples of what I have done with my server. 1. Home Media
Server: Using Plex as my media server platform I have been able to view any of
the photos, movies or music that I would like to make accessible to myself or
anyone else on any device that is connected to the internet. Essentially, I
have created a personal Netflix server -- the difference is that I own and
control the content. Plex is initially free but limited in its free version.
For anyone thinking of using Plex, I would recommend sticking with the free
version as a trial to test whether or not it is the right fit. It is easy to
configure and set up and is very user friendly in walking you through how to
make it accessible to other devices. As of this writing, any user who wants the
unlimited version of Plex can pay a $4.99/month fee or a one-time lifetime fee
of $149.99. Anyone interested should check outÂ https://plex.tv/. 2. Web
Server: A web server hosts websites. Anytime you go to a website it is
displayed to you by a web server. Have you ever wanted to host a website or
build a web application? This is your opportunity. Using Apache HTTP Server as
my platform I have been able to host websites privately. This allows me to
develop and experiment with different ideas that I have for websites for free,
rather than paying for someone for a server to host my website on. As well, it
gives me the platform to learn different web coding languages and experiment
without any risk (or if there is risk of breaking something, it won't cost me
money to undo the mistake if I don't want to). Although Apache and most other
web server software does take quite the learning curve to effectively manage,
it is worth the money saved if you want to make personal projects and deploy
them in a development environment without monetary obligation. Understanding
the basics of a web server is extremely valuable knowledge in this internet
age. As well, there is a huge market for web server administration and support
-- which leads to lots of cash. 3. File Storage Server: Being able to download
or upload files from my server at any location has been possibly the most
useful feature of having a server. Simply put, I can access any data available
on my server and put data on it. This can allow users to share any content such
as music, movies and photos to their own devices or with friends and family.
The platform I have started using for this is OwnCloud. OwnCloud allows me to
use a web interface or app to easily download and upload to or from my server.
I am able to access the storage on my home network from anywhere now and use it
easily and quickly. Check outÂ https://owncloud.org/ for more information.
Although it is apparent that I believe that anyone could benefit from the use
of having a home server, it may not be for everyone and that is okay. However,
for a lot of tech users who have an old computer nobody uses or are trying to
find ways to learn and make technology more useful, I hope this persuades you
to begin. How to get started? Essentially, any decent computer can become a
server. First, make sure you have a somewhat functioning computer. Once you
have decided as to what you would like your server to do, find a platform that
performs that function. There is a huge open-source community that builds and
develops the software needed to administer a server, meaning that most of what
you want to do has probably been built by someone and is available online to
use for FREE. The best way to learn is to start doing it. Feel free to email me
with any questions.
