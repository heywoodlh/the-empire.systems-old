 title: How to Install a New Copy of Wordpress Via Command Line date: '2016-
06-12 23:50:00' tags: - linux - ssh - wordpress  This article is intended to
walk a user through installing a new copy of Wordpress via BASH command line.
First, navigate to the directory which you would like to install the new copy
of Wordpress to. Run this string of commands to download and extract a new copy
of Wordpress to the current working directory in Linux command line:
wget http://wordpress.org/latest.zip; unzip latest.zip; cd wordpress; mv * ..;
cd ..; rm -rf wordpress
As an example, presume you ran this command in the document root folder of
example.com. Upon navigating to http://example.com/ you should find a Wordpress
install page.[Image] This means that Wordpress was downloaded and extracted to
the correct directory. If you do not see this screen, clear your browser cache
and cookies and refresh. If you still don't see this you probably downloaded
and extracted Wordpress to the wrong directory -- meaning you need to locate
your website's document root directory and then run the first string of
commands in the correct folder. Once you have selected the language press
continue.

We now have to create a database that the new Wordpress installation will use.
To run these commands successfully you will need to know your main MySQL
username and password. In this example we will pretend that my main MySQL
username is "user" and my password is "password". In your command prompt run:
mysql -u user -p
Then type in your password to log in to the MySQL command prompt. If it fails
you are most likely using the wrong password or username. Once logged in to
mysql command prompt type in this command to create a database. This example
will create a database named "wordpress".
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
Now that we have a database created we need to assign a user to it. If you
would like to create a new user to it run this command to create the new user
and set the user's password:
CREATE USER 'user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
Once the user is created, or if you have already created the user, run this
command to assign "user" to the database named "wordpress" by granting user
with all the permissions for wordpress.
GRANT ALL ON wordpress.* TO 'user'@'localhost';
Now you are ready to fill out the information needed to finish the Wordpress
information, as shown in the next image. Go back to example.com and press
"Let's Go!". Again, the example image will show the MySQL database user is
"user", with "password" as the password, and "wordpress" as the database name.

Assuming all your file permissions are correct in the document root directory
of your website you should be given a prompt to "Run the Install". ***Common
Error*** If you get an error that Wordpress cannot write to the directory and
to add a file named wp-config.php with the code specified on the screen, you
will need to fix your document root directory permissions to be 755 and ensure
that your web server user is the owner of the folder or you will need to create
a file named wp-config.php with the specified code in it in the document root
of example.com. I would recommend fixing the permissions rather than just
throwing the file in because Wordpress will need the correct file permissions
*** Â *** If the install worked properly you will be asked to then create a wp-
admin username and password, so that you can then login to example.com/wp-admin
and then focus on building your site. If these steps do not work for you or
make sense, feel free to contact us.
