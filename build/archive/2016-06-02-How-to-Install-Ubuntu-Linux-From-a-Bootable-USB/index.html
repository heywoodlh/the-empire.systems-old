 title: How to Install Ubuntu Linux From a Bootable USB date: '2016-06-02
03:02:00' tags: - linux  Some basic terms: Boot:To process for a computer to
load an operating system Operating System:the software that allows you to
interact with the computer -- essentially the personality of the computer (for
example Windows is an operating system, same with Mac OS X, etc.) USB:Universal
Serial Bus, a type of port on a computer, in this case synonymous for a USB
flash drive Bootable USB: a USB that, essentially, has an operating system that
has been installed to it and is capable of allowing a computer to boot the
installed operating system What is Ubuntu?Â Ubuntu Linux is an open source
operating system, perhaps one of the best open source projects online. It is a
free operating system capable of resurrecting old computers and turning them
into useful, working machines again. It has evolved and has become the most
popular of all the Linux distributions currently. It is also probably the most
user friendly Linux distribution, yet it still offers the administrative power
and customizability that Linux is well known for. The purpose of this article
is to walk a user through installing Ubuntu to a computer from a USB flash
drive. The same general principles can be applied to most other Linux
distributions such as CentOS, Puppy Linux, etc. Why would anyone ever want to
do this?My main motivation for doing this was that I had a really old computer
that was very slow with its native operating system. Any Linux distribution
typically is a lot more lightweight and can do a lot more with fewer resources
in comparison to Windows or Mac (although Windows and Mac do have their own
benefits). Another reason would be for the learning. Linux is a great
playground for those wanting to understand web development, coding or how to
use a BASH terminal. How to do it?After creatingÂ an Ubuntu bootable USB, you
can either install it from the flash drive to the computer you have it
connected to or you can just run Ubuntu from the flash drive rather than
competing with the current operating system on the computer. You also have the
option to install multiple operating systems to your computer's hard drive,
although I wouldn't recommend this unless you have a pretty powerful computer
that wouldn't be affected by splitting resources.
1. Create a Bootable USB:Â For each operating system there are different steps
to create a bootable USB.
[Image]To summarize the process of creating a bootable USB you first need to
format your flash drive (choose the FAT32 format preferably as most computers
can read that format). Download the Ubuntu Iso from http://www.ubuntu.com/
download. Next, you would need to use some sort of software such as RufusÂ or
USB_Pen_DriveÂ to install the iso to a flash drive and add the necessary
bootloader files (files needed for the computer to boot the operating system
properly).
Luckily, Ubuntu.com has created articles for each operating system as to how to
make one. For Windows:

For Mac:

For Ubuntu: http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop/create-a-usb-stick-on-ubuntu
Alternatively, if you are wanting to create a bootable USB while using a Linux
computer, I would recommend the program UNetBootin over Ubuntu's startup disk
creator. UNetBootin is a program created just for the purpose of making
bootable USBs for Linux distributions. Essentially, all you would do is insert
your USB into your Linux computer, select the drive in UNetBootin and select
the Linux distribution you would like to have installed to the USB. 2. Restart
your computer and enter the BIOS menu:This is the part that was not so obvious
for me when I first wanted to install Ubuntu to my computer. When I first got
the bootable USB I thought I would plug it into my computer while it was
running and then it would pull up a smart prompt for me to follow to install it
and somehow wipe out the current operating system. This is not the way it
works. Essentially, the BIOS (Basic-Input-Output-System) menu is a set up menu
for the computer before it actually boots into, or "enters", your Operating
System. From this menu you are able to make some basic configuration changes,
one of these changes being what hard drive your computer will boot into.
Entering the BIOS menu varies from machine to machine. What I recommend is
Googling the make and model of your computer with a specific search to enter
the BIOS menu of that make and model. Typically, to enter the BIOS menu at
startup you need to hold a specific button down when you see your computer's
loading menu (not to be confused with your operating system loading menu).
Certain computers may have a prompt to press F12 to enter the Boot Menu whereas
others may not have any indicator of how to do it. From the BIOS menu select
your bootable USB. If you created a good bootable USB Ubuntu will start
loading. If you end up installing Ubuntu it might be a good idea to revisit the
BIOS menu and set the boot order preference, which determines what hard drive
the computer will boot from by default. ***Troubleshooting step 2:Â If there is
some sort of error, you may want to start at step one and try creating the USB
again. If you cannot even see the USB as a drive to boot into, try a different
USB port on your computer.*** 3. Follow the prompts to either try Ubuntu or to
Install it:I would definitely recommend trying Ubuntu before installing it.
Ubuntu is way different than Windows or Mac, the operating systems most people
are familiar with. If you opt to try Ubuntu it will simply leave your current
operating system alone and will run out of your flash drive. For those who love
their Windows OS or Mac OS but only want to get familiar with Linux, I would
recommend just trying it rather than installing it. If you give it a try and
decide you want to install it, restart your computer again and enter BIOS
again. This time select that you want to install Ubuntu. When installing Ubuntu
you have two options: 1. You can either completely wipe out the other operating
system and install Ubuntu in its place (the option that comes up in the prompt
is to Erase Disk and Install Ubuntu) 2. You can install Ubuntu alongside the
other operating system (this would be called partitioning, or splitting, the
hard drive) As mentioned earlier, I would only recommend the second option if
you have a high power computer as the resources would need to be shared between
the two operating systems.
After you have cleared these steps, Ubuntu makes it really straightforward. I
won't elaborate any further as the prompts are very clear. Ubuntu should
install and if you opted in to wiping out the previous operating system Ubuntu
will load from that point on. Hopefully this article makes it a little simpler
as to how to create the bootable USB and boot from the USB. I mostly touched on
what I felt was relevant and what I didn't know when I first attempted to
install Ubuntu from a bootable USB. Another extremely helpful article with
quite a bit more information is found atÂ https://builtvisible.com/the-ubuntu-
