- \]My preferred terminal emulator is Termite, which comes as a package
available in the default Arch Linux repositories. I also use Ubuntu and Linux
Mint often but by default they do not come as a package available for install
in either OS. This article will outline the steps to install Termite in Ubuntu/
Linux Mint.
   1. Download the termite installer script:
      git clone https://github.com/Corwind/termite-install.git
   2. Execute the termite installer script:
      cd termite-install
      ./termite-install.sh
Â  After the script finishes, Termite will be installed on the system and ready
to use!
