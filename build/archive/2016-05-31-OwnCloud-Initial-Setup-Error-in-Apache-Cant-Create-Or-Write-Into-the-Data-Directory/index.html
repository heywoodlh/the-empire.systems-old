 title: 'OwnCloud Initial Setup Error in Apache: "Can''t Create Or Write
Into the Data Directory"' date: '2016-05-31 00:20:00' tags: - apache - linux -
owncloud - server  On initial Owncloud server setup on Apache, if file
permissions of the OwnCloud Directory are incorrect within the web server
hosting the application, an error will occur saying: "Can't create or write
into the data directory..." If you don't want to read. These are the solutions:
Â  1. Verify correct for permissions for your OwnCloud directory are 755 and
change them to 755 if they are not.Â  2. Verify correct ownership for your
OwnCloud directory. The user and group for Apache should own this folder in
order for OwnCloud to properly work. 3. For further support contact your web
host and/or server admin if neither of these solutions work. The resolution to
this issue is to correct the permissions and/or ownership of the file. The
purpose of this post will be to show users how to correct the permissions or
ownership of the file. The resolutions in this example will be for an Ubuntu
Linux server running Apache as the web server to administer Owncloud. However,
the principles are applicable within most Linux distributions. 1. Check
permissions: First, locate the OwnCloud server directory and make sure that the
permissions for the directory are at least 755. Within the file manager of your
server you should be able to see what the permissions are underneath the
"Perms" section.
Another way to view whether or not the directory has the correct permissions is
by running this command via SSH:
     stat /path/to/owncloud
Replacing the "/path/to/owncloud" value with whatever the name and location is
of your owncloud directory within your web server. The output of the command
will probably look something like: File: âowncloudâ Size: 4096 Â  Â  Â  Â 
Â  Â Blocks: 8 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â IO Block: 4096 Â  directory Device: fc00h/64512d
Â  Â Inode: 5901318 Â  Â  Links: 15 Access: (0755/drwxr-xr-x) Â Uid: ( Â  33/
www-data) Â  Gid: ( Â  33/www-data) Access: 2016-05-30 17:35:18.194122630 -0600
Modify: 2016-05-30 17:23:11.006106120 -0600 Change: 2016-05-30 17:23:
11.006106120 -0600 Birth: - (Notice the bolded Access value which includes the
numbers 755). Resolution:If the permissions are not 755 change them to 755.
Within File Manager you should be able to accomplish this by right clicking the
owncloud folder and select Modify Permissions and change them to the
appropriate values. To modify permissions via SSH run this command:
     chmod 755 /path/to/owncloud
2. Check File Ownership If file permissions were all correct, it may be
possible that file ownership may be incorrect (this is very unlikely if you are
using a managed hosting solution that is not a VPS such as Bluehost, GoDaddy,
etc.). Unless you are the server administrator and have root access, you will
not be able to proceed any further in changing permissions (if you do not know
what that means you are most likely not the server administrator and should
contact your host). The owner of the "owncloud" directory should be the Apache
Web Server. In Ubuntu Linux the Apache user is www-data and the group that user
belongs to is also www-data. Find out what the respective Apache user's name is
on your Operating System prior to proceeding. Â To check the ownership of the
file run the command:
stat /path/to/owncloud
On a folder with the correct ownership the output will look something like
this: File: âowncloudâ Size: 4096 Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Blocks: 8 Â  Â  Â  Â 
Â IO Block: 4096 Â  directory Device: fc00h/64512d Â  Â Inode: 5901318 Â  Â 
Links: 15 Access: (0755/drwxr-xr-x)Â Â Uid: ( Â  33/www-data) Â  Gid: ( Â  33/
www-data) Access: 2016-05-30 17:35:18.194122630 -0600 Modify: 2016-05-30 17:23:
11.006106120 -0600 Change: 2016-05-30 17:23:11.006106120 -0600 Birth: - Notice
the UID and GID both are for the www-data user and group (again, in Ubuntu www-
data is the name of the Apache user and group). The Apache user should have
ownership of the owncloud directory. If the Apache user does not have complete
ownership of this folder, Apache will not be able to properly interact with the
folder so that you can use it for OwnCloud. Resolution:Â In order to resolve
incorrect ownership run this command:
chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/owncloud
This command makes the Apache user and group the owner of the OwnCloud
directory. On different Linux distributions substitute www-data:www-data with
the user and group for Apache. This would be the format:
chown -R user:group /path/to/owncloud
If neither of these solutions work please contactÂ us if you would like further
assistance.
