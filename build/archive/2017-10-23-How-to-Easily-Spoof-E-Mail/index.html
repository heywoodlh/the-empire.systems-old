**** Disclaimer ****
I in no way endorse spoofing e-mail maliciously. It is illegal to spoof e-mail
addresses without the permission of the owner. I would highly recommend that
you get written permission of the owner of the domain/e-mail address prior to
spoofing the e-mail. The purpose of this article is to outline the steps on how
to easily spoof e-mail. The legal use of this article will allow system admins
to test their own domains to see if they are vulnerable to e-mail spoofing and
then correct the issue.    
**** Prerequisites ****
1. Vulnerable domain to test on. 2. Server on a public facing WAN IP. This
requirement can be met by spinning up a server on hosting providers such as
DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.    
**** Setup ****
*** Testing the domain ***
This can be done from any machine that has python installed. Download the
spoofcheck repository developed by BishopFox from here. Download the repository
and install its dependencies: git clone https://github.com/bishopfox/spoofcheck
cd spoofcheck sudo pip install -r requirements.txt Then test the domain: sudo
./spoofcheck.py example.com Here is an example of the output of a vulnerable
domain:    Assuming the domain is vulnerable, all that is needed to do is setup
an SMTP server in order to spoof the domain.      
*** E-mail Spoofing Server ***
The server I will be using as an example to setup will be an Ubuntu server on
DigitalOcean -- some of the commands will be specific to Ubuntu. Upon logging
into the server, these commands can be used to install postfix as the SMTP
server: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install postfix   When the postfix
configuration prompt comes up, select "Internet Site":    When Postfix
configuration asks for the System Mail Name, input the domain that will be
spoofed:    Once this is set up, some configuration of the e-mail server should
be performed: sudo vim /etc/postfix/main.cf   Edit the line beginning with
'myhostname':  Change that to the domain you are spoofing.    Then, edit the
line beginning with 'mydestination':  Remove '$myhostname,' from this line. I
would also recommend removing the domain name that you are spoofing from this
line. As you want Postfix to resolve wherever the actual domain is.  The
following 'ubuntu, localhost.localdomain, localhost' are of no concern.   If
you are sending a spoofed e-mail to another e-mail in the same domain append
this line to the very bottom of the file: local_recipient_maps =   Once the
configuration has been edited save the files. If you have already started
postfix, the service would need to be restarted after the configuration would
be edited. This will be true after any time configuration is edited and postfix
has already been started or enabled on boot.   As we have not started postfix
yet, we will start the service: sudo systemctl start postfix.service If you
would like to start postfix on boot: sudo systemctl enable postfix.service  
*** E-mail Spoofing Script ***
A python script for spoofing e-mail has been developed by lunarca here. Install
Python and Pip: sudo apt-get install python python-pip Download the repository
and install the required dependencies: git clone https://github.com/lunarca/
SimpleEmailSpoofer.git cd SimpleEmailSpoofer sudo pip install -
r requirements.txt   Now we are ready to run the script. If you'd like to get
additional flags and usage information use the -h flag: ./SimpleEmailSpoofer.py
-h The script has to use an html file to generate the e-mail contents. I have
created a sample one. Download it with this command: wget 'https://
gist.githubusercontent.com/heywoodlh/91b0361e3a44e6d7ebef79a0f02ee230/raw/
712e5d803b264e8e563b3aaf1b5a298a46b9caa8/email.html' If you would like to edit
the contents of the e-mail, edit the email.html file that has downloaded, or
create your own.     With an html file ready to use this would be the syntax to
use the SimpleEmailSpoofer.py program: ./SimpleEmailSpoofer.py -e email.html -
t targetemail@somedomain.com -f spoofedemail@example.com -n 'Firstname
Lastname' -j 'E-mail Subject'   The -e flag is followed by the file that we
will be using to generate content. The -t flag is followed by the target e-mail
which it will be sent to. The -f flag is followed by the e-mail that the e-mail
will be sent from, AKA the spoofed e-mail address. The -n flag is followed by
the first and last name of the sender of the spoofed e-mail, preferably in
quotes. The -j flag is followed by the subject of the e-mail, preferably in
quotes.   Assuming all went well, the e-mail should have sent and will look
like it was sent from the owner of the spoofed e-mail.    
**** Defense Against Spoofed Domain E-mails ****
In order to attempt to prevent this, a DNS record called an SPF record needs to
be created for the domain, which will help mail servers identify if incoming e-
mail from that domain is legitimate. Implementing DMARC records specified via
DKIM will also make e-mail spoofing much more difficult.
