Developing a WordPress in a Development Environment
Often, people choose to develop their WordPress site in a development
environment. This is done for a few reasons â to develop a site to replace
their current one without disturbing the current live site; to prepare a site
before moving their hosting; or to prepare a site because they do not have a
domain name ready to receive it. An example of a development can be a
subdirectory on the website: i.e. yourdomain.com/dev.
Whenever a WordPress installation is configured to work from a temp URL (we
will use the previous example of yourdomain.com/dev), the database is
configured to use that temp URL for all pages, links, etc. on the WordPress
installation. So for example, if you have created a page in your WordPress site
called âthepageâ, your WordPress installation will go to yourdomain.com/
dev/thepage. That is because your database and your files are configured to use
the URLÂ yourdomain.com/dev/ before every page, post, etc. that your WordPress
site creates.
Therefore, when the site needs to be live on yourdomain.comÂ withoutÂ the /dev/
at the end, there are some things that need to happen in order for that to work
properly.
How to Move the Site to the correct URL
   1. Move your website files to the server you are going to be hosting the
      site on: All of the website files need to be moved to the correct
      directory for yourdomain.com from yourdomain.com/dev. If you are not
      familiar with your file structure for your websites, you should contact
      your hosting provider for additional support on how your file structure
      is set up.
   2. Move your database to the server your site will be hosted on: Export a
      copy of your database from phpmyadmin and import it to the database that
      will be on the server associated with the domain.
   3. Update your home and site URL in your database to the actual URL that you
      hope to have as the actual URL for the site. Log in to phpmyadmin and
      select your database. Find your wp_options table and change the "Home"
      and "Site" table values to equal the correct URL where your site will be
      located.
   4. Make sure the permalinks work properly. If a 404 error shows up on your
      pageÂ go to your wp-admin login (which will now be yourdomain.com/wp-
      admin, not the previous development URL) select Settings > Permalinks >
      click save. If the 404 error persistsÂ click_hereÂ for further
      troubleshooting.
