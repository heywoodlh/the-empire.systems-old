- cybersecurity  GPG stands for GNU Privacy Guard, and does exactly what it
stands for -- guard privacy. Knowing how to use the gpg command is very helpful
when attempting to keep your data secure. The purpose of this article is to
serve as a brief primer on how to use the gpg command by showing some practical
examples.    
**** Some Explanation ****
Before diving into the commands, I'll try to briefly run through some very
basic but useful information on the way GPG uses keys.
*** Keys ***
GPG uses keys to encrypt and decrypt everything. In layman's terms, these keys
are just files stored on a computer that GPG uses to encrypt/decrypt content.
GPG uses high-level cryptography in combination with these keys to securely
guard the content that is encrypted. When creating these keys for oneself, the
process typically requires that you generate a key "pair". This pair consists
of two keys: a private key, and a public key.
*** The Public Key ***
The public key is intended to be made public, as the name implies. The public
key is used to encrypt the information that only a person with the correct
private key can decrypt. For example, if I'm going to send an encrypted e-mail
to Joe at joe@myfakedomain.com, I need Joe's public key. Once I have obtained
Joe's public key I can send him a securely encrypted e-mail that only Joe can
read with his private key.
*** The Private Key ***
The private key is intended to be kept private, as the name implies. The
private key is used to decrypt any information that is encrypted using the
matching public key. In the example above with sending an encrypted e-mail to
Joe at joe@myfakedomain.com, I would encrypt an e-mail for Joe using his public
key. Upon receiving that e-mail that has been encrypted, Joe would use his
private key to decrypt that e-mail and read it.     Now that we have some basic
concepts explained, we will run through some basic, yet essential gpg command
examples.
**** Key Management ****
*** Generate a Key Pair ***
As explained above, GPG uses keys to encrypt/decrypt information. Therefore,
the first thing to do is generate your own key pair: gpg --gen-key This command
will walk the user through a brief GPG key setup wizard. Here is an example
screenshot of the wizard on OS X:  Tips on a passphrase: On OS X, a graphical
prompt appears to enter a passphrase for your key pair, whereas on Linux the
command itself will prompt for a passphrase. I would recommend setting up a
strong passphrase for your key pair. This ensures that only someone with your
private key as well as the passphrase to the key can decrypt your private
information. If you have the key but do not know the passphrase it is almost
useless. So never forget your passphrase!
*** Uploading Your Public Key to a Public Key Server ***
As explained above, your public key is meant to be public. As such, I would
recommend uploading the public key to a key server in order for others to
easily access and download your public key -- enabling them to encrypt
information for your eyes only. gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --send-key
joe@myfakedomain.com In this command I uploaded the key to the public key
server hosted at pgp.mit.edu. This server can be replaced with any public key
server.
*** Viewing Keys ***
An important part of key management is knowing what keys are available. This
command will list all keys in the GPG keyring: gpg --list-keys
*** Finding and Importing Other's Public Keys ***
I would say there are two main ways to get others' public keys: 1. They send it
to you via e-mail or a file. 2. Download it from a public key server. If they
send it to you via e-mail, the contents of their public key will be in the e-
mail or it will be an attached file. Copy and paste that into a text file. If
they send you a file of the public key save it. Once that file is saved, import
the public key using this command. gpg --import /path/to/keyfile If you would
like to retrieve a key from a public key server, this would be the command to
search for that key: gpg --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --search-keys
'joe@myfakedomain.com' Note that you do not have to search by e-mail, you could
also do a search by first and last name. Also note that you can replace
'pgp.mit.edu' with any other key server. Each matching result will be numbered.
For each key that you would like to import, you would enter the respective
number of the key you would like to import and then hit enter. If you would
like to import multiple keys, you would need to enter each number of the keys
you would like to import separated by a comma. Assuming all goes well, you will
then have the keys that you attempted to retrieve in your GPG keyring.
*** Delete a Key Pair ***
As shown in the screenshot, I created a fake key pair for Joe Brown at
joe@myfakedomain.com. As I am not Joe, I want to delete this key pair. To
delete the private key I would use this command: gpg --delete-secret-keys
joe@myfakedomain.com Here is the output:  To delete the public key I would use
this command: gpg --delete-key joe@myfakedomain.com Here is the output:
**** Encrypting/Decrypting Files ****
Once the keyring has the keys needed to work with, encrypting files is not very
difficult.
*** Encrypting Files ***
If I were to encrypt a file for Joe Brown at joe@myfakedomain.com, this is the
command that would be used to encrypt that file: gpg -r joe@myfakedomain.com --
encrypt /path/to/file.txt The file will then be copied and encrypted to a new
file ending in .gpg. Once that file is encrypted, only Joe's private key can be
used to decrypt the file. That file could more securely be sent to Joe via
unencrypted e-mail or another method with a much lower risk that somebody
unauthorized would be able to access that file -- as the file itself is
encrypted.
*** Decrypting Files ***
Assuming I had sent Joe at joe@myfakedomain.com an encrypted file via e-mail,
USB or any other method, once he received that file he would need to decrypt
it. Joe would use this command to decrypt the file: gpg --decrypt /path/to/
file.txt.gpg The file would then be decrypted using his private key after he
entered his passphrase and the file's contents would be printed out.
**** Summary ****
GPG is a very powerful tool for protecting data without sacrificing very much
convenience. Once its basic concepts are understood, using the gpg command is
not very difficult and can provide another crucial layer of protection for
personal and corporate data from the prying eyes of hackers. For further
information I would also check out the GNU_Privacy_Handbook. It has much more
in-depth information. A side note: GPG is synonymous with PGP, Pretty Good
Privacy. GPG and PGP are essentially the same technology, GPG is just a free
and open source implementation of the OpenPGP standard (check out the GPG
website here)
