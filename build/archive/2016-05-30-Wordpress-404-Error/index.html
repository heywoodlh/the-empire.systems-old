404 Error in WordPress Pages
A 404 error is typically caused by incorrect permalinks. You can manually
update permalinks in the .htaccess. However, most of the time, a much simpler
solution is possible.
How to fix the 404 error with wp-admin:
1. Log in to wp-admin
2. Select Settings
3. Select Permalinks
4. Scroll down and press save
Typically, it is that simple.
However, if that does not fix it, here are some other options.
   1. Replace the .htaccess. If you have plugins or a theme that requires a
      modified .htaccess you would need to find the correct code for a fresh
      copy. However, the basic WordPress .htaccess code can be found here.
   2. Disable your plugins through wp-admin. If 404 errors are preventing you
      from doing that, click_here for futher assistance.
   3. Change your theme. If you cannot do that through wp-admin due to the 404
      errors, click_here for further assistance.
   4. Replace core files that may be corrupted or broken. Click_here for more
      information on how to replace a core file.
