 title: Deploy Wordpress on Ubuntu Using Ansible date: '2017-12-05 00:33:43'
tags: - development - linux - server  Doing server administration for quite
a few web servers would be a huge pain without the use of tools such as
SALTStack, Ansible, or Chef. The purpose of this article is to do a basic intro
to using and configuring Ansible and demonstrating how to use it by installing
Wordpress. Disclaimer: I am no expert in Ansible. I don't delve into its deeper
features and there are loads of ways to make it more useful. I use Ansible on a
regular basis and would say I am a shallow user. However, Ansible works
extremely well for me and enables me to get so much more work done than I would
without it. So it works. Prerequisites: 1. Remote server(s) need to be
accessible via SSH 2. The machine that will manage the remote servers has to be
running Unix of some kind. If you have Windows, this can be solved by
installing Cygwin or the Windows Subsystem for Linux.    
***** What is Ansible? *****
Ansible is open source automation software designed to make managing systems
more efficient. The source code for Ansible is hosted on Github: https://
github.com/ansible. It is built with Python and manages servers via SSH. One of
the sweet features about Ansible is that it does not require an agent to be
installed on the host(s) to be managed -- all it needs is access to the server
via SSH. Ansible can be operated in various ways but I have found that it is
most effective to create Ansible "Playbooks". Playbooks are YAML files that
outline a series of tasks for Ansible to complete while running. Once you get
used to the YAML format and understand all of the modules that Ansible has to
offer it quickly becomes trivial to craft new Playbooks. You can use Ansible to
execute single commands on multiple hosts, or just one host, but I have found
that playbooks have been the most useful feature that Ansible offers me. I
would recommend checking out the modules that Ansible offers: http://
docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules_by_category.html.  
***** Configuring Ansible: *****
As stated earlier, Ansible works on remote servers using SSH. In order for
Ansible to work well, I would recommend that the servers be preinstalled with a
user for Ansible to use. I would also recommend that the user have the ability
to execute sudo commands without a password as that can be a little frustrating
if you want to run commands as an admin. As the user Ansible will use will have
a lot of power, I would recommend disabling Password Authentication on SSH and
make sure that user can only be accessed using an SSH key.
**** Set up the Ansible User on an Ubuntu Server: ****
Tip: If you are planning on managing your servers on a platform such as
DigitalOcean, I would recommend creating a template server that is setup to be
managed by Ansible and then creating a snapshot of the server once you are
complete so that way future servers can be preconfigured with your desired
settings and be managed by Ansible as soon as it is deployed.
*** Create the Ansible User on the Server: ***
sudo adduser ansible
*** Give the User Sudo Privileges Without Needing a Password: ***
You will need to edit the sudoers file: sudo visudo Add this line to the very
end of your file: ansible ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL Save your file and exit.
*** Generate an SSH key for the Ansible User: ***
On your machine that will do the management, not the server, generate an SSH
key pair for the Ansible user: ssh-keygen Copy the contents of the .pub file
that is created. If you have never generated a key pair and choose to use the
default location it will be here: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub After copying the public
SSH key that was generated, log in to the server. I would recommend logging in
as the newly created Ansible user if possible. Once logged in, create a .ssh
folder for the Ansible user to use and give it the correct permissions using
these commands: mkdir /home/ansible/.ssh/ chmod 700 /home/ansible/.ssh/ If you
are not logged in as the user ansible when running these commands, run this
command to give the user ansible ownership of the newly created .ssh directory:
chown -R ansible /home/ansible/.ssh/ Then create the /home/ansible/.ssh/
authorized_keys file on the server for the Ansible user: nano /home/
ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys Paste the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub from the
management machine into that new file. Change the permissions for
authorized_keys to be more secure: chmod 600 /home/ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys
On the management machine, try SSH-ing into the server using the keypair you
generated. If you placed the key in a location other than the default ~/.ssh/
location, specify the path to the key by using the -i in the ssh command: ssh -
i /path/to/id_rsa username@hostname.com Assuming everything was done correctly,
you should be logged in to the server without a password needed (unless you set
a passphrase for your SSH key, then you will be prompted for the SSH key
passphrase).  
**** Configure the Management Machine: ****
We will now focus on configuring the management machine. First, install Ansible
to your machine. A relatively cross-platform installation of Ansible is through
pip: sudo pip install ansible   Ansible can be configured in multiple ways, but
I recommend creating a directory for Ansible on your management machine that
contains all of the files that we need in order to manage Ansible and to do the
Wordpress install. This is the file structure that I follow:   ansible-dir
âââ ansible.cfg âââ hosts âââ library âââ .my.cnf
âââ playbooks âââ install-lamp-and-wordpress.yml There are two
config files of note: - hosts: The hosts file contains the host information of
the hosts we will be targeting. This file will hold the hostnames/ip addresses
of the hosts, SSH keys that Ansible will use, what port SSH is running on, etc.
Here is an example hosts file: https://github.com/heywoodlh/ansible/blob/
master/hosts. - ansible.cfg: This file contains important configuration that
Ansible will use to perform the way we want it to. Here is an example
ansible.cfg file: https://github.com/heywoodlh/ansible/blob/master/ansible.cfg.
Edit the hosts file to reflect content similar to this:   [ubuntu-webservers]
192.168.1.50 ansible_ssh_private_key_file=/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa
ansible_user=ansible Change the IP address, path to the SSH private key file
and the Ansible user to whatever you have set up on the server. If you would
like to manage multiple servers in one group you can add as many entries under
the ubuntu-webservers group as you would like. Edit the ansible.cfg file so
that inventory is equal to the hosts file in our ansible directory: inventory =
hosts This way, when we run the ansible-playbook command, we can do it within
the directory set up for our Ansible files. Assuming everything is setup
correctly, Ansible should be in a place where we can deploy Wordpress! You can
test to see if Ansible connects properly to the host by running this command:
ansible all --inventory-file=hosts --module-name ping -u ansible This should
show some output with this line: "ping": "pong" Which indicates the ping was
received by the host.  
***** Deploying Wordpress: *****
Now that Ansible has been configured and successfully tested, we are ready to
deploy Wordpress. You can download the Ansible playbook from here. You will
want to create a 'playbooks' directory within your Ansible directory and place
the download into that folder on the management machine. You can download it to
your machine using these commands if you are within the Ansible directory:
mkdir playbooks curl 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heywoodlh/ansible/
master/playbooks/install-lamp-and-wp.yml' -o playbooks/install-lamp-and-wp.yml
Edit that file: nano playbooks/install-lamp-and-wp.yml Change the credentials
found on lines 4-8 which by default will be: wp_db: wp_db wp_user: wp_user
wp_password: secret_wp_password mysql_root_password: secret_mysql_password Here
is a breakdown of each variable: wp_db: the name of the Wordpress database.
wp_user: the name of the Wordpress database user. wp_password: the Wordpress
database user's password. mysql_root_password: the MySQL root user's password -
- make it extra secure.   You will also need to download a file called .my.cnf
and place it in a directory called library within the Ansible folder. An
example file can be found here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heywoodlh/
ansible/master/library/.my.cnf. From the Ansible directory, you can create the
library folder and download .my.cnf using these commands: mkdir library curl
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heywoodlh/ansible/master/library/.my.cnf -
o library/.my.cnf Edit the .my.cnf file: nano library/.my.cnf Change the
password variable to equal the same secure password referenced in playbooks/
install-lamp-and-wp.yml in the mysql_root_password variable. With the ansible
command installed, our Ansible directory configured, and the Ansible playbook
downloaded and configured, we can now install Wordpress. From the Ansible
directory on the management machine you can run this command to install
Wordpress: ansible-playbook playbooks/install-lamp-and-wp.yml. Not only will
this install Wordpress on the remote server, it will install LAMP Stack and the
necessary PHP modules needed in order for Wordpress to function correctly. Once
the install is complete, one only needs to navigate in a browser to the
hostname/ip address of the Web server to find that the Wordpress installer is
waiting for a user to finish setting up the website.
