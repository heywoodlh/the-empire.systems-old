Disabling WordPress:
There are a few parts of a WordPress Site that need to be altered in order to
disable it.
   1. The .htaccess file: this configuration file helps a browser know how to
      access a website. WordPress has specific code in the .htaccess that helps
      a browser know to initiate the Wordpress installation when it is
      accessing a website with WordPress installed.
      The coding in the .htaccess that allows WordPress to run needs to be
      disabled. This can be done by commenting out the WordPress coding, by
      renaming the .htaccess file, or by deleting the .htaccess file
      altogether.
   2. The index.php file: this file contains coding that determines the
      appearance of your home page. A WordPress installation uses the WordPress
      coding in this file to determine how the home page for a website would
      look. This file needs to be changed by removing the WordPress code,
      renaming the file, or by deleting the file altogether.
   3. Core Files: WordPress core files are the files that are needed in every
      WordPress installation to run. They are generally unchanging from
      installation to installation (except for wp-content). All of these files
      need to be disabled through renaming them or deleting them.
If any of these things are missing, a WordPress site will stop running
properly. However, a partial removal could result in the WordPress Site still
running, just incomplete.
