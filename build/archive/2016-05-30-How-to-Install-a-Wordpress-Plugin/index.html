Plugins:
Plugins are programs that can be installed to WordPress for additional features
added to a basic Wordpress installation.
There are many different vendors that offer WordPress plugins that are
available for purchase and install. Obviously, those plugins need to be
purchased directly through the vendors of the theme. However, there are many
free WordPress plugins that are available and easy to access through wp-admin.
You can view already installed plugins in wp-admin>Plugins.
Install and Activate Free Plugins:
1. In wp-admin go to Plugins>Add New.
2. Select the Category you would like to Browse through Plugins.
3. Browse through the plugins and select the one you would like to install.
4. Click âinstallâ to get it installed to your WordPress installation.
5. If you would like to make the plugin active, after it is installed, press
âActivateâ.
How to Install an External Plugin Manually:1. Locate your plugins folder in
your website files. The path will look like website_directory/wp-content/
plugins.
2. Upload your plugins to the plugins folder.
3. If compressed, extract the compressed file in the plugins folder.
4. Log in to wp-admin.
5. Go to wp-admin>Plugins.
6. Find your new plugin and click âActivateâ
**If you do not see your plugin as a choice, that means that you did not
install your plugin to the correct location, or there are files missing from
the plugin. If you installed it to the wrong location, move the plugin folder
to wp-content/plugins If you are missing files, download the plugin again and
make sure you have the complete version. If it is incomplete, contact the
plugin developer and request a complete version of the plugin.**
