 title: Basics of Linux Command Line (and SSH) date: '2016-06-15 17:07:00'
tags: - linux - server - ssh  When I first began learning about Linux,
command line and SSH were topics that came up pretty regularly. I had a very
vague understanding of what Linux command line was only because of its visual
similarities of Windows command prompt, which I had very little experience
using anyway. SSH was a very abstract and confusing subject to me all around as
I had never heard of or used anything like it. The purpose of this article is
to simply explain what Linux command line and SSH are and share some examples
of how they are used. What is Linux Command Line?
Linux command line, also referred to as shell or terminal, is a prompt that one
can use to interact with a Linux machine. Opening the default Linux command
line, a black screen with white lettering will appear (similar to the picture
below). A user can type in a command to this prompt which will allow them to
interact with the computer. For example, if I wanted to create a file named
"file.txt" I can type in the command touch file.txtÂ and that will create the
file.Â Using a variety of commands a user can essentially navigate to any
virtual location in the computer and do anything they want via command line,
without the need for a GUI (Graphical User Interface).
The list of things that can be done through command line is very broad but here
are three examples of some tasks that one can carry out via command line:
- Install and configure software
- Edit files (especially useful for developers)
- Manage a server
Again, there are a lot more things that can be done through Linux command line
but those are probably the most useful things I do with command line on a more
regular basis.
Why would I want to use command line vs. a normal GUI?
-Speed: For those who become very familiar with Linux command line, it is much
easier and quicker to manage files, configure software on the machine, and a
whole myriad of other things than to do them through a GUI.
-Use less resources: Using a terminal is much less resource intensive than
using a GUI. Using a GUI requires a lot more resources as the machine will need
to generate a screen for the user to use. On newer machines, this shouldn't be
a problem -- for older machines this can help quite a bit. As well, for those
who are stingy on using any resources at all, this is a great way to conserve.
-Simplicity: In quite a few cases -- not all -- it is easier to interact with
your Linux machine through command line rather than using the GUI. Many of the
tutorials online on how to install and configure software on a Linux machine
show how to do it primarily through the command line. As well, once a user gets
familiar with the terminal, it is much more uniform when compared to using the
multiple interfaces of the variety of programs available.   What is SSH and how
does it work? SSH, or Secure Shell, is a process used to remotely access
another machine's command line. This can allow users to remotely access their
Linux machine using much less bandwidth and processor resources in comparison
to a remote desktop client connection. For developers of websites or web
applications, the ability to use SSH can be very helpful in the fact that there
is no need to be within physical proximity of the machine in use. The ability
to edit files is very important for developers, so the ability to edit them
remotelyÂ makes it that much more convenient. For server administrators, SSH is
a way to manage a server remotely. You can reboot the computer, edit server
configuration files, check server logs, restart server software, and so on all
through SSH. SSH works by connecting a client to the host's command line. If
you don't understand what that means, here is an example. I have an SSH server
in my home that I have set up to be accessed remotely by another computer with
the proper credentials. On my laptop, I have the Secure Shell plugin downloaded
and ready to use. I connect to my server at home from my laptop by opening up
my Secure Shell plugin. I then am prompted to enter in the credentials needed
to locate my server and my username and password needed to connect. Upon
entering the proper credentials, I am then successfully logged in to a shell -
- or command prompt -- on my server. From my laptop's Secure Shell prompt I can
enter in specific commands to interact with the server. For example, I can type
in the command rebootfrom my laptop's SSH command prompt and my server would
receive the request and then reboot.Â My laptop is the client, and my server is
the host. Hopefully this article has been straightforward and helpful in
explaining the sometimes abstract concepts of Linux command line and SSH. If
