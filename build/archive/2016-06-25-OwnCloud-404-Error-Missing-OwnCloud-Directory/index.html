 title: OwnCloud 404 Error (Missing OwnCloud Directory) date: '2016-06-25
22:59:55' tags: - owncloud  Background: This article is for those users who
find that their OwnCloud directory has been deleted, either by personal mistake
or someone else's. At one point, when I first started getting used to OwnCloud
I got it all up and running and then a few days later I found that the OwnCloud
directory had been deleted. I don't recall if I had just gotten fed up with
OwnCloud and just decided to delete the directory to clean up my Apache web
server folder, but my OwnCloud directory was gone and I wanted to try OwnCloud
again. There were no helpful articles on how to get it back, but the solution
was pretty easy once I figured it out after I had tried and tried to get a
blank copy of my missing OwnCloud directory.

1. Make sure OwnCloud has already been installed:If OwnCloud has not been
installed, that would be the first issue and may be the fix to your problem.
Follow the steps for your operating system for instructions on how to install
OwnCloud. 2. Attempt to reinstall:After OwnCloud installation has been verified
try reinstalling.Â This can be done by uninstalling OwnCloud and attempting to
install it again. On Ubuntu this can be done by running these commands:
sudo apt-get remove owncloud
sudo apt-get purge owncloud
The first command will uninstall OwnCloud, the second will completely remove
the configuration files for OwnCloud -- essentially wiping OwnCloud out
completely. If you would not like to remove the configuration, void the second
command.
sudo apt-get install owncloud
This will install OwnCloud again, and may resolve the issue of the missing
OwnCloud directory. 3. Download OwnCloud Server Manually:If reinstalling did
not recreate the OwnCloud directory, go toÂ https://owncloud.org/install/# and
download the latest version of OwnCloud, according to your respective operating
system. Extract the downloaded file and you will find the contents are a brand
new OwnCloud directory. Place the extracted contents in the correct location on
your web server. If none of these steps helped feel free to contact us and we
would love to help.
