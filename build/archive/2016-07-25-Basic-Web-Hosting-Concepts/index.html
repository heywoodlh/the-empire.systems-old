***** Domain Name: *****
A domain name, put simply, is the name of a website. Google's domain name is
google.com. Facebook's domain name is facebook.com.
Domain Registration:In order to own a domain name, the domain name needs to be
purchased, or "registered", from a registrar. Think of it like a car. A person
is not legally recognized as the owner of the car until it is registered under
their name. Like a car, domain registration can expire and if it does it is
expensive to reclaim the domain until a certain amount of time. Web hosts are
often also registrars that one can purchase (or register) domain names from.

***** FTP: *****
FTP is an acronym for File Transfer Protocol. It uses port 21.FTP is
essentially just a way for a person to transfer files to and from a server. For
customers of a web hosting company, an example of why this is useful is if one
wants to develop some content for a website on their local computer they can
easily transfer the files to their website's web server via FTP.
Filezillais the one of the most common FTP clients. Knowing that it is
associated with FTP will help.

***** Email: *****
Incoming or Receiving Email - POP3 AND IMAP POP3 and IMAP are two different
processes that allow a client to receive e-mails. POP3 is an acronym for Post
Office Protocol 3. PORTS FOR POP3 ARE 110 (insecure) AND PORT 995 (secure by
SSL).Â When email is set up on a computer using POP3 protocol any email
received will be downloaded to the computer that it received it on and will be
stored there. So if your computer with a POP3 connection dies and you haven't
backed up your e-mails to another location they are basically all gone. IMAP is
an acronym for Internet Mail Access Protocol.Â PORTS FOR IMAP ARE 143
(insecure) AND 993 (secured by SSL)Â IMAP doesn't download, it leaves the email
messages on the server until the user explicitly deletes them. IMAP also allows
multiple client logins to the same mailbox. Difference between IMAP and POP3:
POP3 downloads all the emails to whatever computer that has a POP3 process set
up with, IMAP keeps the e-mails on a server somewhere so that multiple devices
can access them when they connect to a server. Outgoing or Sending Email SMTP
is an acronym for Simple Mail Transport Protocol. web host'S SMTP PORT IS
26.Â SMTP is a protocol for sending e-mail messages.
***** HTML: *****
HTML is the building block of most websites. It is a basic language that is
used to build a website. HTML is an acronym for Hyper Text Markup Language.

***** DNS: *****
DNS stands for Domain Name System (or Service). DNS is a system used to point a
browser to an IP address. An example of how DNS works is for the every day user
on the internet. That user's internet browser does not have all the IP
addresses stored of every website and so DNS allows browsers to locate the
server a domain name is stored on and display whatever is on that server. Many
web hosts are also DNS hosts. They must be able to diagnose DNS issues so that
if the DNS is incorrect they can help the customer take necessary steps to
correct the DNS. There are multiple DNS records that are important: - A Record:
The value of an A Record points to the IP address of the server that a website
is hosted at. If the A record of example.com is pointed to an incorrect IP
address then it most likely won't show up correctly. - CNAME: A CName is
basically an alias for an A Record. So if one has multiple CNames pointing to
one A record that means that they are all pointing to the same IP address. -
Â MX Record:An MX record controls where email is going to be sent to. This
value can be the same location that the website is hosted at or it can be
changed to point to another location where the mail will be hosted. Common
tools to look at DNS information about a domain include the
"dig"Â command,Â and the "whois"Â command.
