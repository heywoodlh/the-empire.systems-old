title: 'Install Arch Linux on Dell XPS 12/Dell XPS 12 Crash on Arch Linux'
collections: all, linux

_TL;DR: set the kernel boot parameter `i915.modeset=0` in Grub and then downgrade to a Linux kernel earlier than 4.16 (preferably an LTS)._ 


## The Dilemma:

_The i985 driver packaged with the Linux kernel beginning at Linux kernel 4.16 was causing the machine to crash._


I am an avid Arch Linux user. I also own a Dell XPS 12 which I use as a more portable alternative to my heavier, larger Macbook Pro. Arch Linux is a natural fit for this machine's operating system. 

I kept running into a specific issue: when booting into Arch Linux, my computer would die. It was frustrating and I found NO help online so that's why I'm posting the fix.

After a very long period of trial and error and perusing through every forum known to man I found the source of the issue: in all Linux kernels beginning at 4.12 Intel began to include the i985 graphics driver in the Linux kernel which apparently is not compatible with the Dell XPS 12. From what I have learned, beginning at 4.16 the code in the i985 driver was changed and lots of other machines began to have issues with the driver (maybe earlier than 4.16 -- I'm at the 4.14 LTS at the time of writing and not have issues).

 

## The Temporary Fix:

_Set `i915.modeset=0` as a boot parameter in Grub._

To actually get my machine not to crash, I had to set a kernel parameter in Grub (press 'e' in the Grub boot menu). The parameter is `i915.modeset=0` (this tells the kernel to not set the i915 graphics driver during startup and let the X server handle it). Once I did this I was able to boot into a super slow but functional Arch Linux system. I ran through my Arch Linux installation and rebooted. 


## The Long-Term Fix:

_Downgrade to a kernel that is older than kernel 4.16 (in this case, the LTS):_

_`sudo pacman -S linux-lts`_

_`sudo pacman -R linux`_

_`sudo reboot`_

I had to set the `i915.modeset=0` parameter in the Grub boot menu on my fresh install once again. Upon figuring out what the issue was I decided to install the `linux-lts` package through `pacman`:

`sudo pacman -S linux-lts`

This installs the LTS Linux kernel which at this time is Linux kernel 4.14.78. I then uninstalled the `linux` package via `pacman`:

`sudo pacman -R linux`

Now that the rolling Linux kernel is no longer an option, Grub will automatically use the LTS after a reboot:

`sudo reboot`




Hopefully this provides help for any Dell XPS 12 users who want to run Arch Linux on their machine. I really could have used this while looking for this issue.
