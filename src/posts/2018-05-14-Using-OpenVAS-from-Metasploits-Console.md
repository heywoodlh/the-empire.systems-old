Metasploit and OpenVAS are awesome open source security tools designed for penetration tests that anybody can use. Metasploit is an exploitation framework designed to make exploiting known vulnerabilities extremely simple. However, before you can know what to exploit you should run a vulnerability scanner to look for vulnerabilities on a network. OpenVAS is an open source vulnerability scanner that ties into Metasploit really well. 
This article will walk through connecting Metasploit to OpenVAS and then running OpenVAS from Metasploit's console. This article will assume that you have OpenVAS and Metasploit already set up on your machine.
Assuming you have Docker installed, you can quickly spin up OpenVAS using this command: 
```
docker run -d -p 443:443 -p 9390:9390 --name openvas mikesplain/openvas
```
### The Commands:
First, open Metasploit's console: `msfconsole` 

Then, load the OpenVAS module: 
```
msf> load openvas 
```

Display the OpenVAS module's help page: 
```
msf > openvas_help
[*] openvas_help                  Display this help
[*] openvas_debug                 Enable/Disable debugging

```

The first thing we need to do is connect to OpenVAS: 
```
msf > openvas_connect 127.0.0.1 9390 
ok 
```
Now, create a target: 
```
msf > openvas_target_create host1 192.168.1.50 'My First Host'
```

List your targets: 
```
msf > openvas_target_list
```

Before we can create a task, let's also list the scan configs that can be used as we will need that to create the task: 
```
msf > openvas_config_list
[+] OpenVAS list of configs



ID Name
-- ----
085569ce-73ed-11df-83c3-002264764cea empty

daba56c8-73ec-11df-a475-002264764cea Full and fast
```

The command for creating a task is this: 
```
msf > openvas_task_create
```     
If we were to use the ID for host1 from my example openvas_target_list above and a 'Full and fast' scan, this would be the command: 
```
msf > openvas_task_create scan1 'My first scan' daba56c8-73ec-11df-a475-002264764cea ddcf992e-c705-455c-8fb3-1fdb4fb5a672 
```
Once the task has been created, list it: 
```
msf > openvas_task_list
[+] OpenVAS list of tasks

The syntax for the report download command is this: 
```
msf > openvas_report_download 
```   

If we were to use the above report ID and TXT format and download the report to the file `~/Downloads/report.txt`, this would be the command used: 
```
msf > openvas_report_download 94919a2f-e338-4b2e-8b49-5f2ab4f6a36b a3810a62-1f62-11e1-9219-406186ea4fc5 ~/Downloads/ report.txt
``` 
Now that the report has been generated, you can view it and use it for your pen test.
