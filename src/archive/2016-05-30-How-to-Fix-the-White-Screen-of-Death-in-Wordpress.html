The White Screen of Death (WSOD)
The White Screen of Death is typically the sign of a break in PHP code. Most of
the time WordPress installations come with an error log that can be viewed at
http://yourdomain.com/error_log where you can view the break in the coding.
It is typically caused by either plugins or themes being incompatible with the
environment that they are in. The factors of the environment and content being
incompatible may be:
1. Your contentÂ isÂ not working with the php version being run on your server.
Updating your php handler may be the solution to the problem, but shouldnât
be done first. You should troubleshoot your theme and plugins first before
updating your version of php.
2. If you have recently undergone a Wordpress update, your content may not be
up-to-date or compatible with the newest version of Wordpress.
Deactivating Plugins:
The best way to fix this is to replace the code that is causing the issue.
However, a temporary fix may be toÂ deactivate the plugin(s) that is causing
the issue. As your wp-admin is most likely inaccessible, you will need to do
this from your hosting server end, through your file manager.
How to deactivate your plugins folder, or individual plugins: 1. Find the wp-
content folder for your site.
2. Find the plugins folder.
3. Rename it to plugins.old or plugins.deactivated
4. Check to see if your site is up and running.
5. If you know what plugin is causing the issue, go into your plugins folder
and deactivate the specific plugins folder by renaming it to .old
How to Change the Theme:
If that does not fix the issue rename the plugins.old folder to plugins and go
to the folder named âthemesâ in your wp-content folder. Look at the
available themes that you have installed there. Preferably, it would be best if
you had the default twentyfifteen, twentyfourteen, etc. themes to use. Keep
those handy for step 3 of this section.
These are the tools available in many LinuxÂ hosting platforms that can help
youÂ to change your theme without have access to wp-admin.
1. Access and find your database in phpmyadmin.
2. Find the database table ending with _options (if there are multiple check
what the database prefix is in the wp-config.php file and find the table
beginning with the specified prefix ending with _options)
3. Find the âTemplateâ and âStylesheetâ rows. Change the values to
whatever default themes you have available in your wp-content/themes folder.
4. Check to see if your site is up and running.
***If deactivating the plugins and changing the theme to a default theme
doesnât work individually, it may be a combination of both and it may be
worth trying to have both the plugins deactivated and one of the default
Wordpress themes running.***
WordPressÂ Core File Issue: If neither of those work, it could potentially be a
WordpressÂ core file issue, meaning that one or more of the core files (core
files are the basic files that are exactly the same in every Wordpress
installation) are incorrect. You can most likely find which one is broken in
the error logs. With core file issues, the best way to do this is to replace
the broken core file with a fresh new copy of that core file from the newest
version of Wordpress. If you canât nail down which core file is broken,
replacing them all may work. You can download a compressed copy of the latest
version of WordPress by visiting http://wordpress.org/latest.zip.
