Simple File Editing
There are a few file editors available in most terminal. For starters, there
are two that are easy to begin with:
1. nano â Nano is a very simple file editor. There are a lot of things that
make it really easy to use and very effective.
     #to edit a file in nano
     nano file
When in Nano it will open up a screen with the file contents displayed. You can
edit and navigate these very easily. To exit Nano, press ctrl+x. The tips at
the bottom have more help (replace the â^â symbol with ctrl).
2. gedit â The command âgeditâ opens up your gedit application on a Linux
server. This is a familiar, easy to navigate, GUI document editor.
     #to edit a file in gedit
     gedit file
