Resetting Your Wp-Admin Password From Your Database In PHPMyAdmin:
Resetting your wp-admin password manually from your database is useful when
your âForgot Passwordâ link is not working properly, you have forgotten
what email is associated with your WordPress user, etc.
1. If you do not know your database name you need to locate your database name,
username and password in the wp-config.php file in your website files. The code
containing the database name, username and password will look like:
 define('DB_NAME', 'DB_name');
 define('DB_USER', 'DB_username');
 define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
These credentials will log you into phpmyadmin, straight to your database.
2. Also in wp-config.php is your database main prefix. Find that as well. The
code should look like:
 table_prefix = 'wp_pref_'

If you have plugins that require similar tables in your database this will be
helpful later.
3. Log in to PHPMyAdmin. Find your database and find the table within the
database ending with wp_pref_users (replacing âwp_prefâ with your database
prefix). Select the _users table.
4. Select your user and select edit. One of the options that will appear will
be password. There will be an encryption setting in that and a password hash
value that scrambles the actual password. Select the function setting of
âMD5â and change your password to whatever you would like. Save your
changes.
5. Log in to wp-admin with your new password.
