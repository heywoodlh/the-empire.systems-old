Instructions for manually moving a WordPress site from one host to another:
The application for this is pretty straightforward: you will need to know how
to do this if you are moving your WordPress website from one hosting provider
to another.
General instructions:
At the old host:
1. Get a backup of website files
2. Export the WordPress database(s) as a .sql file
At the new host:
3. Upload all the website files via FTP to the directory of your website on
your new hostâs server
4. Create a new database (write down the full database name, username and
password for step 6)
5. Import database tables into the new database using a mysql importing tool
such as phpMyAdmin
6. Edit wp-config.php file to point to new database and update database name,
database username and database password

Potential Errors:
If you do all these steps and you get a DATABASE CONNECTION ERROR, that means
that you have the database name, user or password values in wp-config.php
incorrect. The code should look like:
define('DB_NAME', 'DB_name');
define('DB_USER', 'DB_username');
define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
If you do all these steps and you log in to your site you may get a screen
telling you to install WordPress again, make sure you have the correct DB
prefix. You can view the database prefix that you need in your database (notice
the prefix in the upcoming example)  and look at the prefix on each row in your
database that you imported. The code should look like:
table_prefix = 'wp_'
Edit this code to reflect the prefixes in your main database tables. If your
main database tables begin with:
wp_pre
update the table prefix code to:
table_prefix = 'wp_pre'
