**** Description ****
A man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack consists of an attacker intercepting
communication between two machines by somehow getting between those machines
within a network. There are different MitM attacks; arp-spoofing/poisoning, DNS
spoofing, etc. This attack is a web based MitM attack that will trick
computers/users by spoofing the login portal to either Dropbox, Facebook,
Google, iCloud, Linkedin or Live. It is also powerful enough to be impervious
to 2 factor authentication. In this example I will demonstrate using Google as
the spoofed website. The project that makes this possible is called evilginx
and was developed by kgretzky and is available here. It is a Python program
that is extremely user friendly and makes this type of MitM attack very
accessible.
**** Recommended Prerequisites ****
1. Cloud based server with Python and git are installed. In my example, I use
an Ubuntu 16.04 server hosted on DigitalOcean. 2. Convincing domain name
pointing to the IP address of this server. Since I am spoofing Google, I
purchased the domain googlevalidation.com, which looks somewhat convincing as a
URL. 3. DNS configured correctly: for Google spoofing, the subdomains 'ssl' and
'accounts' need to be pointing to the server along with the domain name being
used. In my configuration, I had the A record for googlevalidation.com pointing
to the server, while 'ssl' and 'accounts' were CNAMEs of my domain pointing to
googlevalidation.com.
**** Setup ****
Upon logging in to your cloud based server -- assuming Python is installed -
- setup is not difficult for this service. The README.md file of the repo lays
out the installation steps: git clone https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx cd
evilginx chmod 700 install.sh ./install.sh With my domain googlevalidation.com,
this was the command to set my server up to spoof Google: python evilginx.py
setup --enable google -d googlevalidation.com You will then be prompted if you
would like the server to do verbose logging and Letsencrypt SSL certificates to
be generated. I would recommend responding with yes for both as more logging is
better to analyze and an SSL on a site makes it look more legitimate. Once the
setup process completes, the server should be ready to go. With my setup, I
just needed to go to https://accounts.googlevalidation.com/ and then it would
display the evil portal. Here is a screenshot:  Upon successful login, the
service redirects to a legitimate Google web page. No alarming signs are thrown
up to indicate anything malicious occurred. On the server, the credentials are
logged. I used a test account, but two factor authentication was enabled. Here
is a screenshot of the logged credentials:  Clearly, this e-mail is for testing
only, and I have changed the password since (feel free to try to log in). But
the credentials were logged correctly. These credentials were stored in the
evilginx repository in log/google/test.email89798574@gmail.com/

**** Recommended Distribution Method ****
I will not get into various methods of social engineering, but the attacker
need only get a victim to go to the URL of the domain pointing to the server.
Once an unwitting victim logs in, the attacker then has access to the victim's
Google e-mail address and password.
**** Recommended Defense ****
Aside from not trusting links sent from anyone, I have not come up with a good
defense to this type of attack if the victim does not know the URL is
illegitimate. Even without social engineering, an attacker could spoof the DNS
for google.com and have the victim's machine point google.com to the URL of the
malicious portal. I will update this article with a recommended defense should
I come across one or come up with my own solution.
