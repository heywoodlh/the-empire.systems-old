 title: Dell Equallogic Command Line Examples date: '2017-08-01 17:11:25'
tags: - server - ssh  Here are some example uses of the Dell Equallogic
command line. There was very little explanation as to what all the jargon meant
in regard to SANs and the Equallogic command line when I first started using
Dell Equallogic SANs so I will attempt to explain a few basic terms: 1. Member:
A single SAN. 2. Group: A *group* of individual members or SANs that are all
managed together. 3. Volume: A section of disk space spanning a single SAN or
multiple SANs that are available over the iSCSI network. 4. Management network:
The network from which all the SANs are managed from. From this network, a user
would be able to connect to the SANs from either the web interface or via SSH
and configure settings. However, from this network, a user would not be able to
access the storage of the SAN. Assuming there are multiple SANs in a single
group, as long as one of the SANs is correctly connected to the network, the
entire group can be managed from a signle SAN. 5. Storage/iSCSI network: This
network is the network in which volumes are accessed. Please refer to Dell's
documentation for further information at http://psonlinehelp.equallogic.com/

#### HOW TO ASSIGN IP ADDRESS TO INDIVIDUAL ETHERNET PORT #### ##select
ethernet port syntax member select member_name eth select port_number ##assign
IP to port (after selecting a port) ipaddress 192.168.1.2 subnet 255.255.255.0
##enable management-only mgmt-only enable ##show current configuration (to
verify it is correct) show ##bring interface up up ##bring interface down down
##specific example: select eth3 on member exmem2 member select exmem2 eth
select 3 ##upon selection of port you can then assign an ip address to that
port and use the commands above ##"Note, You need to configure management
interface on the highest eth port for each member in the group with a unique IP
address!"   #### END INDIVIDUAL IP ADDRESS ASSIGNMENT SYNTAX ####   #### GROUP
MANAGEMENT NETWORK #### ##"Enable Management network for the Group (this step
is done after you configure the highest eth interfaces for with the management
IP's for ALL members): ##"You need to enable the management network and assign
a unique Management IP (on the same subnet as the interfaces setup for the
management port) ##"Now enable the management network IP address (this is like
the iSCSI group IP, but is used to connect to the management network from other
systems). This address must be unique and different from the management ip
address you entered for each eth interface."   ##enter group parameter mode
grpparams ##set the group management IP def-mgmt-gateway ipaddress 192.168.1.1
##set the group management IP management-network ipaddress 192.168.1.2 ##verify
group management network settings management-network show ##exit grpparams mode
exit all   ### REMOVE GROUP MANAGEMENT NETWORK ### ##enter group parameter mode
