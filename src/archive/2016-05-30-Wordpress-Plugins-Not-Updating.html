Plugins Not Updating:
Possible causes:
   1. Malfunctioning core files. Typically error logs will alert your to this
      (you can often view them by visiting yourdomain.com/error_log). If this
      is the case, either replace all of the Wordpress core files (which
      normally does not cause any issues), or locate the corrupted core file(s)
      and replace it with a brand new copy. You can get a brand new copy of
      Wordpress at wordpress.org/latest.zip. Unzip the file and copy the core
      file that you need that was corrupted and upload it to your server.
      Disable the corrupted file by deleting it or renaming it to wp-file.old
   2. Faulty plugins. Try disabling each plugin one at a time that does not
      need the update and try updating the plugin each time. If there is a
      plugin malfunctioning that is causing the issue, it should be deactivated
      and replaced. Also if the plugin that is being updated is trying to pull
      an update from a server that no longer exists it will not update.
   3. Malfunctioning theme. Try changing the theme to see if the theme is
      causing the issue.
   4. PHP version. Make sure that the PHP engine version that is being run is
      compatible with the version of WordPress that is being used as well as
      the plugin/plugin update.
   5. Bad connection to the pluginâs update server. Contact the plugin
      developer if this is the case.
