***** Network/Device Security Basics *****
 
**** Description: ****
Cyber security is the practice of defending oneself in the online world. As
everyone and everything becomes more integrated with the web, it is important
to know how to protect confidential information. This article will go over some
basic concepts on how to protect devices and precious data while connected to
the web.
***** Some Recent and Well Known Security Compromises *****
While on the topic of online security, there are some recent compromises that
demonstrate how crucial it is to remain vigilant with devices that are
connected to the internet. 1. John Podesta's Gmail account getting phished:
This is perhaps one of the most embarrassingly simple compromises that lead to
so many problems for the Democratic National Committee as well as the Clinton
Presidential Campaign. John Podesta was, at the time, the chairman of the
Clinton Campaign and as such was the recipient of very privileged information.
The compromise occurred via a "spear-phishing" attack. "Spear-phishing" in
security terms is attempting to trick a victim of the attack with a false
message that attempts to get the victim to somehow reveal confidential
information. In the case of John Podesta, his assistant received an email
claiming to be from Google that someone had tried to use his password and that
it should be changed immediately. The email also included a link to a fake
Google web page where the password could be entered. John Podesta's assistant
correctly consulted with Podesta's IT person who replied that email was
"legitimate" and the assistant proceeded to click on the link to the web page.
The IT person later stated that he meant to say it was "illegitimate". The
attackers then had access to 60,000 of John Podesta's personal information,
many of which contained incriminating information regarding the Clinton
campaign. The emails were later received and made public by WikiLeaks. 2.
Hillary Clinton's private email server getting hacked: In 2016, Hillary
Clinton's emails were being housed in a private email server in the basement of
her home in Chappaqua, New York. Somehow, an attacker was able to get into an
account on the email server and browse through the emails on that account.
There were many security problems in the implementation of the email server.
For the first three months, the emails were being sent unencrypted, which means
that anyone who intercepted the emails would be able to read them. The server
was also remotely accessible from the internet. Which means that if someone
were able to guess the credentials, they could log in to the server and have
complete control. Due to this breach, sensitive information was leaked. 3. CIA
Vault 7 Leaks The CIA recently was victim to a leak from one of their employees
who exposed questionable methods in top secret documents of the CIA in trying
to combat terrorism. Overview: Most of the problems that led to these leaks
were due to people making mistakes, not due to technological issues. Therefore,
people are typically the biggest threat in cyber security -- not technology.  
***** Best Practices *****
 
**** Physical Security ****
Of all security practices, physical security is one of the most important and
perhaps one of the most neglected. Here are some tips on how to physically
secure a work or personal computer: 1. Lock the screen on your computer when
you are away. 2. For devices that contain confidential information, keep them
with you or in a secure location. 3. Do not plug in unknown devices -- such as
a USB flash drive -- to your computer.  
**** Passwords ****
Good practice with passwords is self-evident in its importance. However,
typically good password policy is avoided in favor of convenience. As shown in
the examples above, the information on devices is more important than being
able to easily access the services on the devices. 1. Never send your password
via text message or email, unless they are encrypted. 2. Never store your
passwords on a written document (digital or physical). 3. Never save your
passwords on your browser. A great example of how risky this is Google. All of
the passwords stored for a specific Google account can be accessed on
passwords.google.com. 4. Use a password manager to easily access all of your
passwords, while keeping them secure. Some useful password managers include
Enpass, 1Password and OnePass. Password managers can allow one to create very
complex passwords without having to memorize them but allowing them to be
easily accessed.  
**** Email ****
Email is one of the most easily compromised systems via social engineering.
Being vigilant about email security is crucial to staying secure online. 1.
Never send confidential information over email unless the email itself is
encrypted. If you don't know if your email's contents are encrypted or not -
- they aren't. Overall, stay away from sending anything confidential over
email, period. 2. Be aware of fake emails. If an email is too good to be true,
it most likely is. You are most likely not the heir to a rich African prince's
fortune. Here are some common examples of false emails attempting to exploit
unknowing victims: Dear_Sir,_Request_for_Urgent_Business_Relationship Trust
Fund_for_Alms_and_Ammunition_(Omar_El-Dagash,_Lukmon_Idris) Request_for_Urgent
Business_Relationship 3. Never click on links in emails unless you can verify
that the email is legitimate.  
**** Texting ****
1. Never open links from unknown phone numbers. 2. Never send confidential
information over text. It's not secure. 3. If you aren't sure a text is
legitimate, reply to it. Often the text messages are sent from random phone
numbers.  
**** Applications on devices ****
1. The fewer the better. 2. Always update applications, as those updates
typically include security updates. 3. Don't use outdated applications, when
possible. 4. Download applications from app stores, not from the internet (when
possible). If the application must be downloaded from the internet, check if
the application has been updated on a regular basis and download the updates
when they come out. Most applications that are downloaded online will check if
they have an update available and alert you.  
**** The Internet of Things ****
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to the large array of devices that can
connect to the internet but are not conventional internet-connected devices.
Internet of Things devices can include smart fridges, smart TVs, smart
microwaves, external webcams, etc. Security problems with Internet of Things
devices have caused much greater risk of people's devices at home getting
hacked. Not only do the devices themselves have the risk of getting
compromised, but they can also put other devices such as phones or computers at
risk of being compromised. 1. Don't connect IoT devices to the internet, when
possible. 2. Make sure IoT devices stay updated. 3. Don't buy cheap IoT devices
-- buy quality IoT devices from an established vendor. Cheaper Internet of
Things devices are normally coming from a company that is going to stop
providing security updates to those devices in favor of pursuing other
financial opportunity. Buying these devices from a more established company
typically ensures that the devices will remain secure for much longer.
