***** Wordpress Plain Permalinks are the only type of permalinks that work for
me! *****
I ran into it today and I'm writing this post to document the solution. I will
keep this post as short as I can and do some brief explanation as to what could
cause this error.
**** Possible Causes: ****
 
*** 1. Mod_rewrite is not enabled on the server. ***
Mod rewrite is an Apache module that allows URLs to be changed to something
else that is more user-friendly or customized. The true URL to a lot of
articles can look pretty bad and so this module can be really useful in making
a website easier to navigate as well as providing memorable URLs to articles.
If this module is not enabled, Wordpress will not be able to do anything with
the permalinks on your website. Solution: If you are using a dedicated web
host, they most likely have mod_rewrite enabled on the server -- and even if
they don't, there really isn't much that can be done about it. For web server
administrators, however, mod_rewrite can be enabled using this command: sudo
a2enmod rewrite  
*** 2. The web server does not have permissions to modify .htaccess in the
Wordpress site's root directory. ***
The .htaccess file handles a lot of what happens right when a user comes to a
web page. The web server needs to be able to modify lines of code in this file
if permalinks are to be changed. Solution: Modify the permissions of .htaccess
in the Wordpress root directory and make sure they are at least 600. The
recommended permissions are 644 for most web servers, however. These
permissions give the owner of that file (the web server) the ability to read
and write this file. For web server administrators, ensure that the ownership
of the .htaccess belongs to the webserver user on top of ensuring the correct
permissions are set. On Debian-based distributions like Ubuntu, the web server
user is "www-data". On RedHat Enterprise Linux and CentOS, the user is
"apache".  
*** 3. Incorrect Apache configuration. ***
This is a relatively vague cause of permalinks not working because there are so
many ways that Apache can be configured incorrectly. For me, this was the cause
of my permalinks not working and I will post the solution for my issue
specifically, although it most likely will not fix it if Apache is indeed
configured incorrectly. Solution: *This is only for administrators. If a user
is hosted on a proper web host, the host should have this configured correctly.
Ensure that the "AllowOverride" directive in the main Apache configuration file
as well as any other virtual host configuration file that is relevant is set to
allow all overrides. The main configuration file for Apache is /etc/apache2/
apache2.conf. The same file on RedHat and CentOS is located in /etc/httpd/conf/
httpd.conf. Make sure that any lines like this: AllowOverride None are changed
to look like this: AllowOverride All This directive determines whether or not
URL overrides in .htaccess will be accepted or not.     As there could be a
myriad of other issues causing this problem I have kept this list to only
things that I have seen that are common. Hopefully this is helpful to anyone
running into this issue!
