WordPress Core Files:
    * Q: What is a WordPress âcore fileâ?
      Wordpress core files refer to the standard installation files that are
      found in every single WordPress installation. Essentially, core files are
      every single file in a WordPress directory except for the wp-content
      folder and the wp-config.php file â as both of those house info that
      are unique to a WordPress installation.

Malfunctioning core files can break an entire website. This is important to
know how to do as it may help you fix a broken WordPress site. It may not even
be the cause of an entire website breaking, but some key features of your site
may not work properly until you replace a broken core file.
You can most likely identify malfunctioning core files in the error logs of
your website, typically able to be seen from yourdomain.com/error_log.
With core file issues, after identifying the problem file, the best way to do
this is to replace the broken core file with a fresh new copy of that core file
from the newest version of WordPress. If you canât nail down which core file
is broken, replacing them all may work. You can download a compressed copy of
the latest version of WordPress by visiting http://wordpress.org/latest.zip.
Replace core files by disabling or removing (removing or deleting is not
recommended) the old wp folders and/or wp files that you would like to replace,
and swap it in for a new version of the latest WordPress core file.
-Helpful Tip: Whenever making file changes to a site it is recommended not to
delete the file or folder but turn it into a backup folder that is disabled.
This can easily be done by renaming the WordPress folders and files to wp-
file.old (replacing âfileâ with the folder or file you want to replace).
-Helpful Tip: A folder of common core files that may be causing issues is wp-
includes. That is a directory that seems to have problems often as the coding
in wp-includes is drawn upon by plugins, themes, etc.
