Deactivating Plugins:
Deactivating plugins from your files is very useful if your site is breaking
due to a malfunctioning plugin, if you want to deactivate all of your plugins,
or a few of them very quickly or for any other reasons you need to deactivate
your plugins. For this method,Â will need to do this from your hosting server
end, through your file manager, or through SSH.
To deactivate your plugins folder, or individual plugins:
1. Find the "wp-content" folder for your site.
2. Find the "plugins" folder.
3. Rename it to "plugins.old" or "plugins.deactivated"
4. Check to see if your site is up and running. If it is, one of your plugins
is causing the issue.
5. If you know what plugin is causing the issue, go into your plugins folder
and deactivate the specific plugins folder by renaming it to .old
