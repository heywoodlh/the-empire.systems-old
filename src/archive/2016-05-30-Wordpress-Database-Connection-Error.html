WordPress Database Connection Error
All WordPress installations need two things: WordPress files and a database. If
either of those are missing, a WordPress installation will not function
properly.
A database connection error is just that â WordPress files not being able to
connect with a database. This can be an indicator of two things:
1. There is no database to connect to.
2. The WordPress installation is not configured properly to connect to the
database.
If there is no database to connect to, there is not very much to do except for
locate that database.
However you can fix a database connection error if the configuration is
incorrect, and this typically is the case.
There are a few things that you can do to fix this:
1. Locate the code for the database name, username and password in the wp-
config.php file for your wordpress installation. It will look like this:
 define('DB_NAME', 'DB_name');
 define('DB_USER', 'DB_username');
 define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
2. Make sure that the DB_name, DB_username and DB_password are the correct
credentials for you to log in to the database that is for the WordPress
installation. If the database name or username are incorrect, fix them. Update
your database user to have the password in between each single quote mark.
3. Make sure that the layout for each value is correct. I.E.
define('DB_NAME', 'DB_name')
If there is a single quote missing or mispelling, the error will be showing,
and your WordPress installation may not work.
4. The error may be caused by a broken theme or plugin. Click_here for more
