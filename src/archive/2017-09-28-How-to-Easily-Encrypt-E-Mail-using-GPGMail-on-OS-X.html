 title: 'How to: Easily Encrypt E-Mail using GPGMail on OS X' date: '2017-
09-28 17:22:44' tags: - cybersecurity  Working where I do requires a way in
which to communicate securely without sacrificing convenience. Using e-mail
alone is insecure. However, encrypting e-mails makes it virtually impossible
for someone to intercept and read e-mails unless they have the correct key.
However, the concepts behind using GPG can be a little confusing to first-time
users. The purpose of this article is to show users how to set up GPGSuite on
OS X and encrypt e-mail in order to make it secure and show practical examples
of the GPG Suite in use. By the end of this article, I hope that using GPG and
some of the basic concepts of e-mail encryption make sense.  
**** Why Should I Encrypt E-Mails? ****
E-mail alone is extremely insecure. The information being sent over e-mail is
sent in plain text, meaning that if an e-mail is intercepted it can be read.
Encrypting e-mail provides a mechanism to prevent unauthorized third parties
from reading e-mail that is not intended for them.  
**** Install GPGSuite ****
Go to the GPGTools_website. Download the GPG Suite .dmg file. Mount the image
and run the installer.  
**** Generate a GPG Key Pair ****
What is a GPG key pair? A GPG Key pair consists of a private and public GPG
key. Each of these keys contain a huge amount of random characters that the GPG
program can read and use to encrypt and decrypt files, in this case e-mails.
The public key is used to Open the GPG Keychain application and press "New".
This will open a wizard to generate a public and private GPG key. You will then
be prompted to name the key and set a passphrase for the key. This passphrase
will be required each time you use the key unless you save the passphrase in
the keychain. A password is not required, but definitely recommended as an
extra layer of security if somehow the private key was stolen. A pair will need
to be created for each e-mail address in which GPG encryption will be
implemented. The generation may take some time and will often benefit if you
are doing work on other applications as the key uses entropy, or random
generation, to create a more random -- and more secure -- key pair.    Once the
key pair have been generated you will see it listed as you can see the two key
pairs I have generated on my machine in the above picture. In order for people
to more easily access your public key I would recommend right clicking on the
key pair that have been generated and select "Send Public Key to Keyserver".
This will send your public key to a public keyserver and allow people to search
for your public key and send you an encrypted e-mail that only you can decrypt
with your private key. Your public key is intended to be public and does not
provide a security risk if someone obtains it because that only enables them to
send encrypted e-mails to you, while only YOU can decrypt it assuming you keep
your private key secure.    
**** Import Another Public Key ****
In order to send an encrypted e-mail to somebody, you need to import their
public key into your keychain. You can lookup another user using the "Lookup
Key" button. In this screenshot I looked up my own public key by typing in my
personal e-mail into the lookup utility.  Import the key by selecting "Retrieve
Key".  
**** Send an Encrypted E-mail ****
  Now that you have the public key imported of the person you will be sending
an e-mail to, you are ready to send an encrypted e-mail to that person. In the
Mail application an OpenPGP plugin, GPGMail, has been installed due to the GPG
Suite install performed earlier. GPGMail integrates the GPG Keychain into the
OS X native Mail application to encrypt and decrypt E-mails. Assuming your e-
mail address is the one used to generate the GPG key pair and you have imported
the public key of the e-mail address that you will be sending to all you need
to do is click the lock icon in the Subject row.    Upon sending or receiving
an encrypted e-mail, you will have to enter the passphrase for your key pair if
you have a passphrase. Assuming the email was encrypted, there should be an
indicator that states the e-mail is encrypted, like so:
