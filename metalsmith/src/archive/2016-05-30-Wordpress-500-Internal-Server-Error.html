500 Internal Server Error:
The 500 Internal Server Error is rarely caused by the hosting server of a
website. Normally the 500 error is caused by a broken .htaccess file that is
preventing the server from interacting properly with the website and preventing
anyone from displaying the website.
Common fixes:
1. Replace the .htaccess file:
To do this log in to your file manager. Make sure that you are viewing the
hidden files because if you are not viewing the hidden files you will not be
able to view the .htaccess. Before modifying any files, you should always make
a backup of the file, so copy the .htacccess and make a backup. Or you can
rename it to .htaccess.old and make a new file called .htaccess.
Regardless, if you make a new file or a copy, this is the code you can use for
a basic wordpress .htaccess:
     # BEGIN WordPress

     <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteBase /
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
     RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
     RewriteRule . /index.php [L]
     </IfModule>

     # END WordPress

Check to see if your website is working.


2. Disable plugins:
Often times, plugins you have may be modifying your .htaccess, even after you
change the .htaccess to the default .htaccess.
You can follow the steps in this article to disable plugins:

3. Disable the theme:
Rarely does a theme cause this issue. However, if the previous two options have
not worked out, changing the theme may work.
Follow the steps in this article to change the theme:

***If none of these options are working separately, it may be a combination of
all three***
If all of these options do not resolve the problem, you may need to contact
your hosting provider or contact a web developer for further assistance.
