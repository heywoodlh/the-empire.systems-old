 title: 403 Website Error date: '2016-05-30 03:40:00' tags: - wordpress 
403 Permission Denied Error:
This error is caused when website files have incorrect permissions, denying
access to those who wish to view it.
File permissions are are tools used to allow or deny access to three groups of
people:
1. User: The owner of the file.
2. Group: A group of users.
3. Other: Everybody else.
There are three abilities that permissions control:
1. Read: The ability to read, or view, a file.
2. Write: The ability to alter the content of a file.
3. Execute: The ability to execute or run a file.
A 403 error is displayed when website file permissions forbid access to the
person trying to view a website. This can be simply remedied by changing the
permissions to be the correct permissions.
Linux Default Permissions:
Default Folder Permissions: 755
Default File Permissions: 644
Each ability has its own numerical value.
1. Read: 4
2. Write: 2
3. Execute: 1
When viewing permissions it is viewed in order User, Group, Other with the
abilities viewed in the order of read, write, execute.
For those with difficulty understanding this concept, we will use folder
permissions as an example:
The default permissions for a folder is 755
User     Group     Other
7            5            5
rwx         r-x         r-x
The user has the ability to read, write and execute (4+2+1)
The group has the ability to read and execute (4+1)
Everyone else has the ability to read and execute as well (4+1)
