 title: Wordpress/Web Server Penetration Testing Tools date: '2017-12-04 21:
40:25' tags: - cybersecurity - server - wordpress published: false  As a
Wordpress developer and server admin I often follow simple steps to test the
security of my VPS running Wordpress. There are so many useful tools out there
but I will only focus on a few that can help improve visibility:
    * nmap
    * wpscan
    * openvas
  I will walk through some basic usage for each of these tools. All of these
tools are available on Windows, OS X and Linux, except for OpenVAS. OpenVAS is
strictly built for Linux -- which means it can be run on OS X or Windows using
Docker. However, I would recommend dedicating a computer or a virtual machine
to run Kali Linux for anyone who would like to do serious penetration testing.
For developers who do not have access to the server nmap will not be extremely
helpful in the situations I will show as nmap will be used to identify ports
that commonly used services will be running as well as the operating system.
Openvas and wpscan will help a developer find issues with web applications. In
this case, Wordpress will be the web application.  
***** nmap *****
Nmap is a tool used for network mapping (hence the name nmap). The following
two commands I will use will attempt to identify the ports that are open on the
the server and its operating system.  
*** Identify open ports: ***
sudo nmap -sS hostname.com  
*** Identify OS: ***
sudo nmap -O hostname.com Knowing what ports are running as well as knowing
what operating system is running on your target is pretty essential to knowing
what your attack approach should be.
*** Aggressive scan: ***
sudo nmap -A hostname.com This will gather a lot of information and will
attempt to be a lot more intrusive in order to gain more intel. One thing to
keep in mind is that doing an aggressive scan will be much easier to identify
if the target is running some sort of Intrusion Detection Software. So unless
the target has no security in place whatsoever, it may not be the best idea to
do an aggressive scan.
*** Service and Version Scan: ***
sudo nmap -sV hostname.com This will attempt to find out what services are
running on the target as well as what version of the service is running. Also,
this scan is a little more intrusive so it may not be best if you are hoping to
avoid detection. However, being able to identify the version of services
running can often be valuable for identifying specific exploits for the
respective version.  
***** wpscan *****
Wpscan is a utility for scanning Wordpress instances. It follows a very simple
syntax: ./wpscan http://urltoscan.com Despite it's initial simplicity, wpscan
can be an incredibly useful tool for developers looking to secure their
Wordpress instance. Upon doing a scan, wpscan will output a whole bunch of
potential security vulnerabilities that it can identify on the target. Overall,
the warnings are fairly readable and a simple Google search can often lead to a
solution to remedy the issue.    
***** OpenVAS *****
Of all of these tools, OpenVAS is probably the most difficult to setup, but
will produce the most successful and helpful scans. OpenVAS
