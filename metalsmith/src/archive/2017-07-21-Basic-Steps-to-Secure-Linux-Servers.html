***** Securing Linux Servers *****
The importance of securing Linux servers that are running key applications is
self-evident. I see attempts to compromise the servers I manage at least a few
times every hour. The purpose of this article is to provide some basics steps
to secure a Linux server in order to mitigate these hacking attempts. This
article is written for anyone just beginning with Linux. If you would rather
not read the explanations just refer to the "How to: " portion of each section.
 
**** Disable Root SSH Login: ****
The root user is the administrator on every Unix based operating system. That
means on Linux, Mac OS X, BSD and other operating systems that are Unix
descendants have this user on their systems. If on an SSH server, remote login
is not disabled for the root user a hacker can attempt to crack the root user's
password by brute force. Brute forcing is attempting to continuously try
passwords until the password is accepted. If remote root login is disabled not
only will hackers have to get what password is needed to be used but they will
also need to guess what username is being used on the server to login with SSH.
Assuming that the other user has sudo access, the root user should not be
needed to be logged in with anyway.  
*** How to: ***
I would recommend making sure that you have another that you can log in with
and make sure that user has sudo access, in order to still fully control the
server before proceeding with these steps. In openSSH on Linux, root login can
be disabled by editing the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file. This file needs to be
edited by the root user or by a user with sudo privileges. Before disabling
root login I would recommend testing that you can login with another user and
execute sudo commands with said user. Change this line (making sure to remove
the comment or '#'): PermitRootLogin yes to: PermitRootLogin no Then, restart
ssh: Ubuntu/Debian syntax: sudo systemctl restart ssh.service RedHat/CentOS
syntax: sudo systemctl restart sshd.service Now, the root user cannot be used
to login to the system remotely.  
**** Disable Password Authentication -- Use Key-Based Authentication ****
Passwords are somewhat secure based on how complicated a user makes their
passwords. There is a better alternative to password authentication, however,
and that is key-based authentication. An SSH private key is a file that stores
a huge string of randomly generated characters that permit a user to login to a
server that recognizes that key. The SSH private key is tested against a public
key to verify if it is the correct key or not. This is what an SSH private key
looks like: --BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-

 Clearly, this type of file would be difficult to falsify or replicate.  
*** How to: ***
Do steps 1-3 on the machine that will be connecting to the server, not on the
server itself. Step 4 will be on the server. 1. Generate the private/public key
pair On Mac OS X, Linux or BSD the ssh-keygen command will walk the user
through generating a public and private key pair. Make sure that a folder named
.ssh has been created in the home directory before running the ssh-keygen
command. Here is an example walkthrough of the ssh-keygen command: ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair. Enter file in which to save the key (/
Users/heywoodlh/.ssh/id_rsa): /Users/fakeuser/.ssh/id_rsa Enter passphrase
(empty for no passphrase): Enter same passphrase again: Your identification has
been saved in /Users/fakeuser/.ssh/id_rsa. Your public key has been saved in /
Users/fakeuser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub. The passphrase can be empty, but I would
recommend using a passphrase as that will encrypt the keys which will make them
very secure. *Generally, you will want to store the id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files
in a folder named .ssh in the user's home folder. This way, the connecting
machine will automatically attempt to use the key before attempting to use a
password to login to the server. On Mac, the folder would be /Users/
username/.ssh/ while on Linux it would be /home/username/.ssh.   2. Give more
secure permissions to the ~/.ssh folder, the id_rsa file and the id_rsa.pub
file. On Mac or Linux the commands to do this would be the following: chmod 700
~/.ssh chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa*   3. Copy the contents of ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
into the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys file in the user's home directory that you will
be using to log into on the server. Copy the correct key by running this
command on the local machine: ssh-copy-id user@64.29.120.2 Replace 'user' with
the username on the server and the specifying the correct IP or hostname of the
server that will be logged into. Then attempt to login as the user: ssh
user@64.29.120.2 If all goes correctly, logging in will not require a password
-- unless a passphrase was set when creating the keys. Enter the passphrase and
it should log in.   4. Disable password authentication. Change this line in /
etc/ssh/sshd_config: #PasswordAuthentication yes to: PasswordAuthentication no
Then reset SSH: On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl restart ssh.service On RedHat/
CentOS: sudo systemctl restart sshd.service Now password authentication is
disabled and key based login should be the only way to login. Any machine that
will be used to ssh into the servers will need to have the ~/.ssh/id_rsa file
copied to it.  
**** Change the Port SSH Uses: ****
This step is one I usually don't take -- but is very effective at mitigating
brute force SSH attacks. SSH uses port 22 by default. Hackers typically scan
the web for servers with port 22 open and will attempt to login as root into
that server. Assuming key-based authentication is enabled, this is an extra
layer of security that shouldn't be necessary but is extremely useful in
providing another hoop for a hacker to jump through.  
*** How to: ***
On the server, change this line in /etc/ssh/sshd_config: Port 22 to: Port 1022
(or any other port number you'd rather use -- just remember it) Then restart
ssh: On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo systemctl restart ssh.service On RedHat/CentOS:
sudo systemctl restart sshd.service If logged into the server at the time, the
SSH connection may break, requiring the user to login again. Do so but specify
the correct port on the server: ssh -p 1022 user@64.29.120.2 (replacing 1022 if
another port was specified for SSH to use) This will deflect hackers in
attempting to exploit port 22.  
**** Use UFW for Simple Firewalling ****
UFW is a very simple firewall that comes with Ubuntu and can be installed on
Arch Linux as well (sorry RedHat/CentOS guys). It is a simple command line tool
that allows the user to interact with iptables, Linux's super powerful but
somewhat complex firewall. The syntax is really simple. In order to allow port
22 (for SSH) run this command: sudo ufw allow 22 Replace 22 with any other
ports that are needed such as port 80 for web traffic or port 443 for https
traffic. Once the rules are in place enable ufw: sudo ufw enable Now only
network traffic using the ports that were specified will be accepted by the
server. The rules in ufw can be modified at any time after they were created.
