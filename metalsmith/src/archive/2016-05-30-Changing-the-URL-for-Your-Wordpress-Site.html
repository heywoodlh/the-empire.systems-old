Changing the URL in Your Database
Often times WordPress users like to set up their websites in a development
environment. This development environment can be in a subdomain
(dev.yourdomain.com) on an addon directory to your main site (yourdomain.com/
dev) or on a temporary URL. Regardless, whenever you are building your
WordPress site on a URL that you are not intending to be the final URL, you
will eventually need to change your database URL to the URL that you hope to be
the permanent.
1. If you do not know your database name you need to locate your database name,
username and password in the wp-config.php file in your website files. The code
containing the database name, username and password will look like:
 define('DB_NAME', 'DB_name');
 define('DB_USER', 'DB_username');
 define('DB_PASSWORD', 'password');
These credentials will log you into phpmyadmin, straight to your database. 2.
Also in wp-config.php is your database main prefix. Find that as well. The code
should look like:
 table_prefix = 'wp_pref_'

If you have plugins that require similar tables in your database this will be
helpful later.
3. Log in to PHPMyAdmin. Find your database and find the table within the
database ending with wp_pref_options (replacing âwp_prefâ with your
database prefix). Select the _options table.
4. Find the rows with âHome URLâ and âSite URLâ. Change the values from
the old URL to the new URL that you would like to be the permanent. Save your
changes.
5. Check your site at the new URL to see if it is functioning. Make sure that
you test out any pages or other links on your website as they are most likely
broken and showing a 404 error.
***If you have a 404 error on your pages, there is a very simple fix: Go to
your WordPress login > Settings > Permalinks > click save. That should fix the
issue. If not click_here for additional help.***
