page will provide some basic Salt commands that will allow a user to download

***** Updating Windows Minions: *****
Updating Windows minions is a little bit of a process. You have to list the
available updates, download them, and then install them. I prefer managing the
updates using GUIDs, rather than KBs. List available updates for all Windows
minions: salt -G 'os:Windows' win_wua.list_updates The output should display
the updates and their respective GUID. You need to download the update using
it's GUID and then you can install it. Note the GUID and copy it down. To
download the update to all Windows minions, this is the command: salt -G 'os:
Windows' win_wua.download_update [GUID] Once the download is complete, install
the update: salt -G 'os:Windows' win_wua.install_update [GUID]
