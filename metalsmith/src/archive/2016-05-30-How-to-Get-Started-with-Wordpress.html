WordPress is a great website builder and is very easy to use, once you are
familiar with it. However, it takes a little bit of a learning curve to
understand for those who are not familiar with Wordpress.
What is WordPress?
Wordpress is a website builder that can be installed to a domain to easily
build a website. Rather than requiring the domain owner to code their own
website manually, WordPress offers a great admin interface, great looking
themes and plugins to easily add useful features to the website.
WordPress Terms:
âWP-Admin: wp-admin is the administrator interface used to customize a
WordPress website. From the wp-admin dashboard you can access and customize the
features of a WordPress installation such as themes, posts, plugins, etc.
Typically, wp-admin is accessed by going to yourdomain.com/wp-admin (replacing
âyourdomain.comâ with your domain).
âThemes: A theme is essentially a layout for your WordPress installation. It
includes the background and the basic outline of the layout of your website.
Different themes offer different customization options, but overall include a
background and navigation features such as menus.
âPosts: A post can be compared to an article. Posts are made on pages. This
article, for example, is a post on my WordPress installation. Posts can have
varying content, such as pictures, text, etc.
âComments: Very simple- these are comments made by the visitors or the
administrator on the website to facilitate discussion.
âPlugins: Programs that can be installed to WordPress for additional features
outside of the default WordPress features. An example of what a plugin can do
is create a form, add security features, change fonts, etc.
