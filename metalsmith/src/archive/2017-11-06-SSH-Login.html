 title: SSH Login date: '2017-11-06 22:23:00' tags: - server - snippets --
- You can log into an SSH server easily. You need a few things: 1. The IP
address or hostname of the host that you will be logging into. 2. The username
that you will be logging in with. 3. The password or private key to log in to
the server. This is the syntax to log in to an SSH server: ssh
username@192.168.1.100 Replacing 'username' with the correct username and
'192.168.1.100' with whatever IP/hostname of the server you will be logging
into. If you get an error stating permission denied you are either using the
wrong username, password or key.
