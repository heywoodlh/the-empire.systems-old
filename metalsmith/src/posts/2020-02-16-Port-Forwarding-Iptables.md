This article will walk through setting up a simple port forward using `iptables`. 

I found very few resources for setting up a port forward with a device with a persistent Wireguard connection, so this is a simple way to set that up.

## Script:

This simple script can be used to initiate the port forward in `iptables`:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

PORT=7070
SERVER_PRIVATE_ADDRESS=10.100.100.1
CLIENT_ADDRESS=10.100.100.2

EXTERNAL_INTERFACE="ens3"
INTERNAL_INTERFACE="wg0"

iptables -P FORWARD DROP

iptables -A FORWARD -i ${EXTERNAL_INTERFACE} -o ${INTERNAL_INTERFACE} -p tcp --syn --dport ${PORT} -m conntrack --ctstate NEW -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i ${EXTERNAL_INTERFACE} -o ${INTERNAL_INTERFACE} -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A FORWARD -i ${INTERNAL_INTERFACE} -o ${EXTERNAL_INTERFACE} -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i ${EXTERNAL_INTERFACE} -p tcp --dport ${PORT} -j DNAT --to-destination ${CLIENT_ADDRESS}
iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o ${INTERNAL_INTERFACE} -p tcp --dport ${PORT} -d ${CLIENT_ADDRESS} -j SNAT --to-source ${SERVER_PRIVATE_ADDRESS}

```

Modify the variables as needed. I won't explain each of the variables as they should be self-explanatory.

As an example, you could place the script in `/opt/scripts/expose-7070.sh` and make it executable:

```bash
sudo chmod +x /opt/scripts/expose-7070.sh
```


## Systemd Service:

To ensure the script runs on boot, a systemd service can be used to execute the script (assuming you placed the script in `/opt/scripts/expose-7070.sh`):


```bash
[Unit]
Description=Port forward port 7070

[Service]
ExecStart=/opt/scripts/expose-7070.sh
User=root

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Place the above into `/etc/systemd/system/expose-7070.service` and run the following command to ensure the service runs on every boot and also runs now:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable --now expose-7070.service
```


That should run the script on each boot and should have loaded the rules now.
